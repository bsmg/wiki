# üìñ BSMG Wiki &nbsp;[![CI Status](https://github.com/bsmg/wiki/workflows/Wiki%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bsmg/wiki/actions)

## ‚úèÔ∏è Contributing

If you wish to contribute, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/bsmg/wiki/pulls) with your changes. A wiki maintainer will review your contributions and merge them in if deemed appropriate.

Don't know where to start? Checkout this [crash course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r6IP6l3uo8rc__GxfLkpaToxheeXotdYaKEj3oWB2js/edit?usp=sharing) on making contributions!

Alternatively, users who are unsure on how to work with Git can [submit an issue](https://github.com/bsmg/wiki/issues) that contains a link to a shared google document with the text you would like to contribute. Note this will take longer to process than submitting a pull request.

### üåê Localization &nbsp;[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/bsmg-wiki/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/bsmg-wiki)

Translation efforts are managed using [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bsmg-wiki).
There you can see the status of each language available that needs translating.

#### Want to Help Translate?

[Apply Here](https://forms.gle/e3BqA3poMjESARe76) and make sure you are in the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods). We will be in touch!

If you don't see your language available on Crowdin you can still [apply](https://forms.gle/e3BqA3poMjESARe76) and we will add it once you are accepted!

## üß™ Development

To preview your changes, you'll need to [enable GitHub Pages from GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-with-a-custom-github-actions-workflow) for your forked repository.

Once the workflow is complete, any changes made to the `master` branch will be deployed to `https://{username}.github.io/{repository_name}/`, where `{username}` is your GitHub username and `{repository_name}` is the name of your forked repository.
