# Staff

_プロジェクトの管理、プラグインの承認、中枢サービスの管理、イベントの調整、そのほか多くの見えないプロジェクトなどたくさんのタスクがあります。 この素晴らしい個人が貢献した膨大な時間がなければ、このコミュニティは存在しないでしょう。 彼らに感謝をしましょう。(そして、可能なら支援をお願いします)_

## Bloodcloak

邦楽とEDMが好きで、たまにK-POPを聴く人。 Loves creating dance style maps and playing rhythm games. _Totally_ hasn't fallen into the Vtuber hole and makes computer code that works! _"Most"_ of the time...
