# Mapping Supports
The Mapping Support role is a symbol of thanks. Thanks for the thousands of messages sent in the mapping discussion channel and time spent building and maintaining the mapping resources to help people learn how to make maps. We don't typically give this role out, but when we do it's because someone has gone above and beyond for the server.

## Alzaraf
For some reason, spends way more time talking about mapping then actually mapping.

## fruhead
Un mappatore che si concentra sulla creazione di mappe accessibili per esperti minori e sottostanti. Originalmente entro nella creazione di mappe per aggiungere altre mappe rock e metal per competere con le mappe weeb e nightcore, per poi finire per crearne altre. Testa le mappe a occasioni, sebbene abbia lo Stress Post Traumatico dal 1999 e sia il redattore ufficiale. Creator of the [Beginner's Guide to Mapping tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5F3WJ0s0nscdpqiWlOpM_4tJcF-CnWbm).
