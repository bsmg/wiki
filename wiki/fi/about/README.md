# Tietoa meistä
Oletko ikinä miettinyt kuka on tehnyt sinun lempi modin tai on tehnyt modi asentajan? This page tells you a little bit about some of the major Beat Saber modding community contributors. The community wouldn't exist without the blood, sweat, and tears of these amazing volunteers.

> *Huomautus: jotkut ihmiset saattavat mennä usean osion alle, joten yritin lajitella nämä sivut parhaani mukaan. Jos haluaisit jotain muutettavan osiosi alta, ota vapaasti yhteyttä meihin tai osallistu itse!*

## Keitä olemme

### [Ylläpito](./staff.md)
The team that runs the show at the forefront and behind the scenes. Whether it comes to project management, plugin approval, managing the core services, event coordination, or many of the other secret projects, there's always lots of work to be done. The community wouldn't exist without the countless hours contributed by these incredible individuals, so please give them a virtual round of applause (and help pay for the services if you can...)

### [Moderaattorit](./moderators.md)
Kun palvelin on niin suuri, tarvitaan paljon moderointia että kaikki pysyy hallinnassa. Voit kiittää tätä tiimiä siitä. että se pitää kadut puhtaina.

### [Modaajat](./modders.md)
The game as we know it wouldn't exist if people didn't want to add their own spin to it. These are the modders who have spent countless of their own hours to help us personalize the game.

### [Tuki](./supports.md)
Tuki rooli on kiitoksen symboli. Thanks for the thousands of messages sent in the support channels to help people sort out their mods, and for building a knowledge of troubleshooting base through macros and the wiki.

### [Mapping Supports](./mapping-supports.md)
The Mapping Support role is a symbol of thanks. Thanks for the thousands of messages sent in the mapping discussion channel and time spent building and maintaining the mapping resources to help people learn how to make maps.

### [3D Artistit](./3d-artists.md)
From sabers to notes, custom models have always been a popular aspect of modded beat saber which wouldn't be possible without them.

### Mappaajat
Each of your favorite maps is carefully crafted and tested over many hours by a talented mapper. As much as we'd love to include them here too, there are WAY too many of them. If you like someone's maps, give it a thumbs up in game, review it on [BeastSaber](https://bsaber.com), or tell them personally! They'll really appreciate it.

> Furthermore, there is a community run discord to help connect mappers/artists with clients if you would like to commission something. We encourage you to reach out in the [Beat Saber Commissions server.](https://discord.gg/4RbcH5G)

### [Mapping Resources Contributors](/mapping/mapping-credits.md)
A group of experienced mappers that took the time to write down and share their knowledge to help others get started or improve. Checkout their maps and consider supporting them!

### [Event Winners](./event-winner.md)
Winners of past contests/events held in the discord. Keep up with `#server-announcements` for such events happening now, or in the future!
