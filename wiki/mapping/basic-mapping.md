## Ready to Map?
**Have you…**
1. [x] [Downloaded Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and chosen a [map editor](/mapping#map-editing-resources)?
2. [x] [Set up your audio file](/mapping/basic-audio) to confirm your bpm and make sure you’ve got a good intro/outro?
3. [x] [Exported](/mapping/basic-audio#exporting) your song file as an OGG?

::: tip Are all these things done?
GREAT! You're ready to dive into your favorite editor and start mapping! If not, click the links on the task list for more information.

## The Essentials
Before you can even think about mapping, you need to understand the basics.
### Map Files
Regardless of what editor you choose to map with, every map needs:

* **Song File:** OGG format, you must have this ready before you can map.
* **Cover Image:** JPG or PNG, must be perfectly square between 256 and 512 pixels per side. You must have this before you can release your map.
* **Info File:** Contains all of the metadata for your map as a whole. Things in this file apply to ALL difficulties (i.e., song name, artist name, mapper name, song file name, cover image name, etc.). This file is automatically created by your editor.
* **Difficulty Files:** One per difficulty in your map. Things in this file apply to just the one difficulty (i.e., note placement, light placement, note jump speed, etc.). These files are automatically created by your editor.

When you’re ready to prepare your song for upload you must have a minimum of four files.
### Block Types
Directional Blocks | Dot Blocks | Bombs | Walls
-------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------

Must be hit in the  
direction of the arrow | Can be hit in any direction | Causes damage when struck  
but safe for players | Damages players but  
ok to rest sabers

### Block Distribution
As a *very general* rule of thumb for new mappers, blocks should be distributed roughly as follows:

* 60-80% on the bottom row
* 10% or less on the top row
* The rest on the middle row

For more on row usage in different difficulties, see [Gauging Difficulty](/mapping/basic-mapping#gauging-difficulty).

>If you’re using [Mediocre Map Assistant](/mapping/mediocre-mapper) or Mediocre Mapper (outdated) as your editor you can hit <kbd>SHIFT+TAB</kbd> to open the error checker then click “Stat Panel” to see this breakdown.

>Certain styles of maps (like dance maps) will have a higher percentage of blocks on the top row but always remember to consider your target audience and their comfort.

### Timing & Rhythm
Before you start mapping in earnest you need to think about the rhythm of the song you want to map. You’ll place blocks on one or more of the main instruments in the song: the drum beat, lead instrument, bass, synths, or even vocals. 

To place blocks in time with the rhythm you’ll need to change your cursor precision. Most (but not all) songs will use 1/1, 1/2, or ¼ cursor precision to get on beat. Some songs may use “triplets” or ⅓ cursor precision but this is more rare. You should not need to use less than 1/4 cursor precision for most songs *including* mapping to vocals.
> 9 times out of 10, mapping with high precision (1/8, 1/16, 1/32, or 1/64) will make your song seem mistimed!
{.is-warning}

1/1 Cursor Precision | 1/2 Cursor Precision | 1/4 Cursor Precision
-------------- | -------------- | --------------
Image 1 | Image 2 | Image 3
1 block per beat | 2 blocks per beat | 4 blocks per beat

When timing out your map you’ll want to double check EARLY that the waveform in your editor is lined up with the major lines of the editor track. If your waveform isn't lined up, revisit the [Basic Audio Setup](/mapping/basic-audio) page of the wiki for tips.
>If your waveform isn’t lined up it will make it **very** difficult to place blocks in time with the music. Get this right before you start or risk remapping later!

Needs audio edits, start offset, or has wrong bpm | You’re ready to map!

**Timing Notes**
Consider starting the mapping process with placeholder or “timing” notes. Dropping a “dot note” placeholder can help you figure out whether or not your map is on time and where you should consider using extra emphasis **before** you invest a ton of time creating patterns. Listen to make sure the editor hit sounds are in time with the beat.
>Not all mappers use timing notes but they can be a helpful way to ensure your maps are timed correctly as a new mapper>
