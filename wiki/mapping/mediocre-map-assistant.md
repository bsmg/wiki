## Editor Setup

### Windows Installation

1. Download MMA2.zip from [BSMG Git](https://git.bsmg.wiki/Top_Cat/MediocreMapAssistant2/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the file and place the extracted folder wherever you like on your hard drive.
3. Double click `mediocremapassistant2.exe` in the extracted folder to run.

::: warning
It is **VERY** important to unzip the file in step 2 and only run the exe in the new folder instead of the one inside the
zip as not doing so will cause issues with map creation and editing!
:::

#### First Time Setup

The first time you run MMA2 you will need to direct it to the location of two folders: `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels`.
You have several options available to you:

**If you have Beat Saber installed on the computer:**

- Give MMA2 the path to the two appropriate folders
  - Steam Example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
  - Oculus Example: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`

**If you have the Quest version -OR- don't have Beat Saber installed on the computer:**

1. Download `mapping-folders.zip` from [BSMG Git](https://git.bsmg.dev/bloodcloak/mapping-qstart/releases/latest) which
   contains pre-formatted folders that mimics a game install.
2. Extract the zip to a location of your choice.
3. Enter the path to the CustomLevels and CustomWIPLevels folder near the bottom of the Settings Bar.
   - Example Path: `C:\Users\bsmg\Documents\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`

- Alternatively, you can make two folders called `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels` and then provide the path to them.

::: center
![Screenshot of Mediocre Mapper path entry](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-folder-path.jpg)
:::

All of your working map files will go into a song name folder within this CustomWIPLevels folder.

### Linux Installation

1. Download MMA2.zip from [BSMG Git](https://git.bsmg.wiki/Top_Cat/MediocreMapAssistant2/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the file and place the extracted folder wherever you like on your hard drive.
3. Follow the Proton installation steps for your Linux Distribution.
4. Open Steam. At the top of the window, go to `Steam > Settings > Steam Play`. In the `Advanced` section, check
   `Enable Steam Play for all other titles` if it isn't already. Restart Steam if you are prompted to do so.
5. On the bottom left of Steam's main window, click `Add a Game`, then `Add a Non-Steam Games`. A window opens, click
   `Browse` at the bottom. Select `All Files` as the file type. Find where `MediocreMapAssistant2.exe` is, and add it.
6. Search for `Proton` in the Steam search bar, then install the latest version.
7. Right-click the `MediocreMapAssistant2.exe` shortcut, and open the Properties menu. Check `Force the use of a specific
Steam Play compatibility tool`, and select the latest version of Proton in the dropdown menu. At this step, you might
   also want to rename and add an icon to the shortcut as Linux cannot read the built in logo for MMA2.
8. You can now use MMA2 by starting it through Steam. You can also create a shortcut by right-clicking the MMA2 shortcut
   in Steam, then under the `Manage` section clicking `Add Desktop Shortcut`.

#### Linux First Time Setup

The first time you run MMA2 you will need to direct it to the location of two folders: `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels`.
You have several options available to you:

**If you have Beat Saber installed on the computer:**

- Give MMA2 the path to the two appropriate folders, prefixed by `Z:`.
  - Example: `/home/bsmg/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomWIPLevels` should be entered
    as `Z:/home/bsmg/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomWIPLevels`.
- To find where Beat Saber is installed, right-click Beat Saber in Steam, go to `Manage > Browse Local Files`.
- The folders should be located under the `Beat Saber_Data` directory.

**If you have the Quest version -OR- don't have Beat Saber installed on the computer:**

- Make two folders called `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels` and then provide the path to them. Note that the usual Linux
  paths need to be prefixed with `Z:`.
  - Example: `/home/bsmg/MMA2/CustomLevels` and `/home/bsmg/MMA2/CustomWIPLevels` should be entered as
    `Z:/home/bsmg/MMA2/CustomLevels` and `Z:/home/bsmg/MMA2/CustomWIPLevels`

::: center
![Screenshot of Mediocre Mapper path entry for Linux](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-linux-path.png)
:::

All of your working map files will go into a song name folder within this CustomWIPLevels folder.

### Check the WIP File Path

The path given from setup may not carry over from the main screen. Make sure the fields have the paths from your setup and
are not blank. If blank, add the path(s) from [First Time Setup](#first-time-setup) and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to confirm!

::: center
![Check Paths Not Blank](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-checkWipSongPath.png)
:::

### Editor Settings

Once you've set up your paths, these core settings are all available from the song selection page when
you first open the program.

::: center
![Song Selection screen in Mediocre Map Assistant 2](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-song-setup.jpg)
:::

#### Map Selection

The map selection pane has four tabs, each with songs listed alphabetically.

- **WIP Songs:** This tab contains all of the map folders saved in your `CustomWIPLevels` folder. New maps are created
  here and are accessible in-game under "Custom WIP Levels."
- **Custom Songs:** This tab contains all the downloaded custom songs saved in your `CustomLevels` folder. Maps are
  accessible in-game under "Custom Levels."
- **Multi-Mapper:** This tab contains any maps being collboratively worked on via the _Mediocre Mapper Server._
- **Temp Loader:** This tab allows you to temporarily "quick preview" zip files online (i.e., from #testplays, BeatSaver,
  or BeastSaber) without downloading and extracting them.

There are several functions available to you on this screen:

- The <kbd>Refresh Song List</kbd> button refreshes the songs listed.
- The <kbd>Edit</kbd> button next to a map opens it in MMA2.
- The <kbd>Delete</kbd> button next to a map perma-deletes it.
  **Note:** Once deleted this way maps are gone forever and unrecoverable.
- The <kbd>Star</kbd> button next to a map favorites it, bumping it to the top of the list.

::: danger
Maps deleted by the delete button in MMA2 are not sent to the Recycle Bin and are **permanently removed.**  
This includes the autosaves folder. Please be certain and/or keep backups of your work in a separate location.
:::

#### Map Creation

Below the map selection pane you can create a new empty song folder in `CustomWIPLevels` by entering the desired name of
your folder (typically Song Name or Artist - Song Name) then clicking <kbd>Create Level</kbd>.

#### Settings

The settings pane includes global settings for autosaving, zip packaging, folder paths, and more.

- **Autosave Settings:** Autosave is enabled by default at an interval of 300 seconds (5 minutes). This is generally fine
  for most users unless you are doing a light-heavy map. Autosave while playing the song in the editor is also enabled
  by default.
- **Mapping & Lighting Settings:**
  - No lighting is off by default, meaning that any lighting events placed on the lighting track will play.
    Check to prevent lights from playing while mapping.
  - You have the option to provide MMA2 with an alternate folder to save your packaged songs.
    By default the packaged song will be found in the same folder where the uncompressed map lives.
- **Beta Settings:** If you have the Mapping Extensions mod installed you will have additional checkboxes enabled for
  "extended" mapping features like precision placement, precision rotation, and six-lane. New mappers are encouraged to
  skip this until they're more comfortable with the basics.
- **Legacy Settings:** If you have the Chroma mod installed you can check this box to enable the Chroma lighting toolbar
  but it has been unsupported for some time.
- **Other Settings:** Click the <kbd>Clear Settings</kbd> button to revert to default settings.
  You may also enter new paths for either of your song folders. If for some reason nothing works
  you can click the <kbd>Everything Inexplicably Broken?</kbd> button to delete your config file.

::: warning
Confirm both folder paths are complete on the Song Selection screen and add the path(s) from
[First Time Setup](#first-time-setup) if blank.
There is a known bug that deletes the CustomWIPLevels folder path on first use.
:::

## Song Setup

Once you've finished one-time editor setup you're ready to create your first map.

### Song Creation

You have two options to create your song folder:

1. Enter your desired folder name in the 'Create New Level' pane and click <kbd>Create Level</kbd>.
   Your new folder will automatically appear in your map list.  
   ![Using "Create A New Level" to make a song folder](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-create-new-level.jpg)
2. Navigate to your `CustomWIPLevels` folder and make a folder with your desired folder name.
   You will need to click <kbd>Refresh Song List</kbd> to see your folder.

Click <kbd>Edit</kbd> to enter your song information and metadata.

### Song Info Settings

The `Song Info` page is the first screen you see every time you edit a map.

::: center
![Mediocre Map Assistant 2 song setup screen](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-song-info.jpg)
:::

#### Whole Map Settings

On the left side of the `Song Info` page is information that applies to your whole map.
See [Beat Saber Metadata Criteria](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehotupIYMVlc8x41JldO-24m7Am-oTVYnciF9KCRdNM/edit)
for standards on presenting complex song names and multiple artists.

::: warning
Special characters such as those found in, Japanese (日本語/にほんご), Kaomoji (٩(◕‿◕｡)۶), Chinese (汉语/漢語),
Arabic (اَلْعَرَبِيَّةُ‎), and accented characters (Ä/é/õ/Æ/ø/ß/Œ/Ð/ƒ) are not fully supported by BeatSaver.
Using these characters in song metadata or in bookmarks will cause problems.
:::

- **Song Name:** The primary name of the song
- **Song SubName:** Any following tags like (Short Ver.), (SDVX Mix), etc.
- **Song Artist:** The person or group who authored the song
- **Mapper:** This is YOU! It's recommended you list your name the same as your BeatSaver user name
- **BPM:** The tempo of the song. It's _critical_ to get this right before you start.
  See [Basic Audio Setup](./basic-audio.md) for guidance
- **Audio File Name:** The name of the song file (including the extension) you have placed in
  `CustomWIPLevels > [Song Folder]`. Recommended to just name it _song.ogg_ to avoid the pitfalls of special characters
- **Preview Start Time:** Position in the song file, in seconds, of the start of the in-game menu song preview.
  Defaults to 12s
- **Preview Duration:** Duration, in seconds, of the in-game menu song preview. Defaults to 10s
- **Cover Image Name:** The name of the image file (including the extension) you have placed in
  `CustomWIPLevels > [Song Folder]`. Must be perfectly square and at least 256 px
- **Environment Name:** A dropdown menu of the default environments or platforms available.
  See [Basic Lighting Practices](./basic-lighting.md#environment-previews) for an overview of these environments
- **Custom Platform:** The copy/pasted name of a custom platform from [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Platforms/).
  This feature is glitchy and it's recommended that you JSON edit any custom platform information

The <kbd>Open Song Folder</kbd> button will open your song folder in Windows Explorer.
This will help you confirm that you have your files in the right spot.
The <kbd>Package Song to Zip</kbd> button will remove your autosaves folder and zip the files for BeatSaver.
The <kbd>Save Song Info</kbd> button commits all of your metadata to the Info.dat file

#### Difficulty Settings

On the right side of the `Song Info` page is the area where you create individual difficulties and edit data that only
applies to a single diffculty level.

To create your first difficulty:

1. Click the **<kbd>Add Difficulty</kbd>** button.
2. In the **Difficulty** dropdown select which difficulty you want to make (easy, normal, hard, expert, or expertplus).
3. In the **Characteristic** dropdown you can select Standard, No Arrows, or Single Saber.
4. **Difficulty Label** is optional and allows you to give your difficulties custom names in-game.
   If left blank, the difficulty set in the dropdown will be displayed instead.
   _This feature may not reliably work on all VR models_.
5. The **Note Jump Speed** field is where you change the speed at which the notes move down the track.
   Click into the field for a pop-up of helpful information. See [Basic Mapping Practices](./basic-mapping.md#gauging-difficulty-down-mapping)
   for guidance on setting an appropriate NJS for your difficulty.
6. The **Spawn Distance Modifier** field allows you to adjust how far down the track your blocks appear.
   Changing this value will adjust the "jump distance" guidance pop-up.

::: tip
You **must** click <kbd>Apply Modifications</kbd> if you make a change to difficulty settings, otherwise it will not be
saved. In MMA2 this appears to automatically happen when you enter a song file for editing.
:::

Click <kbd>Edit Level</kbd> when you're ready to start mapping!

#### Color Override Settings

You can set the environment color overrides for the selected difficulty using the squares on the right side of the
`Song Info` page. Hovering over a square will list what override the square is for. Clicking on the square will bring
up the color picker. Right clicking on the square will remove the overridden color (returning back to the default color).

- `colorLeft` and `colorRight`: Color of the left and right hand blocks
- `obstacleColor`: Color of the walls
- `envColorLeft` and `envColorRight`: First pair of lighting colors
- `envColorLeftBoost` and `envColorRightBoost`: Second pair of lighting colors

#### Other Settings

- **Contributors Tab:** This left side tab is an optional spot to give credit to mappers, lighters, playtesters or other
  contributors to your map. Enter the contributor role, their name, and the file name of a square "profile image" which
  you place in your song folder.
- **Extra Fields:** This right side tab allows you to include in-game viewable warnings (i.e, Seizure Alert), information,
  suggestions (i.e. Use Chroma), and requirements (i.e., Mapping Extensions)
- **Autosaves:** This right side tab allows you to easily restore an autosaved version of your map if you've crashed or
  need to revert work.

### Mapping Settings

Mapping settings can be accessed by clicking the hamburger menu in the top right while editing the map. It can also be
toggled using the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key. These settings persist throughout your mapping session but will be reset the next
time you open the editor. The `Mapping Settings` pane also includes a comprehensive list of keybindings.

::: center
![Mapping Setting screen in Mediocre Map Assistant 2](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-mapping-settings.jpg)
:::

- **<kbd>Move WaveForm to Other Side</kbd>**: This button will shift the wave form from the left of the mapping track to
  the left of the lighting track. Useful during the lighting process.
- **Playback Speed:** Will slow down the map and song in the editor. Decimal values representing pecentage
  (i.e., 1.0 = 100% speed). This feature is helpful when timing particularly gnarly sections of a map.
- **Editor Scale:** Adjusts the spacing of the beat markers on the map to help with visibility. Increase the number to
  spread notes or lighting events out more for easier placement.
- **Note Sound:** Allows you to select from several in-editor hit sounds to help with timing.
  Select `None` to turn off hit sounds in the editor. _This does not impact hit sounds in-game._
- **Music Volume:** Adjusts the volume of the song in the editor only. 100% by default.
- **Hit Volume:** Adjusts the volume of the hit sounds in the editor only. 100% by default.
- **Metronome Volume:** Adjusts the volume of an in-editor metronome. 0% (off) by default.
- **Enable WaveForm:** Toggles the wave form visualizer on and off. The wave form is incredibly helpful for timing but
  it very resource intensive on your CPU.
- **Move Every Object (in beats):** Allows you enter a decimal value in beats, positive or negative,
  to shift ALL objects that number of beats up or down the track. Helps you fix hot starts if you didn't
  correctly set up your audio file.
- **<kbd>Apply Move:</kbd>** This button will commit the note movement specified above.
- **<kbd>Make/Delete Bookmark</kbd>**: This button will add a bookmark at the current cursor placement if one doesn't
  exist (add a name and hit enter to save) or will delete an existing bookmark.
- **<kbd>Set Preview Start at Cursor</kbd>**: This button allows you to quickly reset the beginning of your in-game music
  preview at the cursor location.

## Editor Controls

There are usually multiple ways to accomplish the same action,
however the keyboard shortcuts at the link below are the most efficient.

The [Mapping Settings](#mapping-settings) menu has a comprehensive list of keybindings.
You can also check out the [Editor Keybinds](./editor-keybinds.md) page.

## Error Checker

The **Error Checker** functionality is one of the top quality of life features found in MMA2.
Access the error checker by clicking <kbd>SHIFT+TAB</kbd> to check for vision blocks, double directionals,
stacked notes, and view map stats.

### Finding & Interpreting Errors

This section walks you through basic usage of the error checker's primary functions:
**Check for Double Directionals, Check for Vision Blocks**, and **Check for Stacked Notes**

#### Navigating the Error Checker

Here is the main panel for the Error Checker:

::: center
![Error Checker main panel](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-ec-panel.png)
:::

1. **Minimum Time:** The minimum amount of time in beats that will be checked. Leave it alone.
2. **Maximum Time:** The maximum amount of time in beats that will be checked.
   You'll need to adjust this based on both the BPM and NJS (Note Jump Speed) of your song/level.
   **_1.5 beats is the minimum recommended for new mappers._**
3. **Double-Directional Checker:** Highlights any instances of a block of the same color pointing in the same direction
   within the number of beats specified in _Maximum Time_.
4. **Vision Block Checker:** Highlights any instances of blocks or walls obscuring or hiding a block within the number
   of beats specified in _Maximum Time_.
5. **Stacked Block Checker:** Highlights any instances where multiple blocks are stacked on top of each other.
6. **Clear Errors:** Clears highlighting from all error blocks. They're still errors, just not marked.
7. **Previous/Next:** Jumps you backwards or forwards through your map to each highlighted error.
8. **Stat Panel:** A wondrous box of delicious statistical information that can help you ensure that your map is leveled
   appropriately and follows row placement best practices.
9. **Lightmap Integration:** Not part of error checking, and not covered in this guide, but this is how you can add fast
   (but terrible) lights.

#### Highlighted Errors

Once you click <kbd>Check for {error of your choice}</kbd> pay attention to the bottom center of your screen.
Red text will pop up that tells you how many errors were found within the specified number of beats:

::: center
![122 errors found... don't do this. This is bad.](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-errors_found.png)
:::

- Only one error can be highlighted at a time.
- Clicking one error button immediately after the other will wipe out the error highlights and replace
  them with the next type.
- Use the previous and next buttons to jump from error to error to resolve them.

**For Double-Directionals:** The highlighted block is the second instance of a same color-same direction, so look back in
time to see the first block in the sequence. You can change either the first instance or the second instance to correct
the error. Once you've made your change you can click "Check for Double Directionals" again to see if the issue is
resolved. You can change the max time value to suit the speed of your song. 2.0 beats is a good baseline for new mappers
but the faster the song the more beats you may need for a reasonable reset (if that is your intention).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Example | Explanation |
|:---:|:--- |
| ![Double directional example](/.assets/images/mapping/dd_example.png) | In this example, max time is set to 0.75 beats.<br />There is a set of down notes 1/2 beat apart and then a set of diagonal notes 1/2 beat after that. The first set of blocks isn't flagged but the next two are because they are double directionals within 3/4 (0.75) of a beat after the first set.<br />You have two options:<br />*Change one of the blocks<br />* Force the player to "reset" (return their arms/hands to a neutral position) if there's enough time. |

::: tip
Keep clicking the "Check for Double Directionals" button... sometimes fixing one error can create a new error out of your
line of sight. Check early and often!
:::

**For Vision Blocks:** The highlighted block is being obscured by the blocks immediately in front of it within the specified
distance. This guide won't get into details on vision blocks but mappers should be very selective when placing any blocks
in the center two positions as those are at eye-height for the player in-game and are not-so-affectionately referred to as
"facenotes." Blocks in other positions can be vision blocks as well but the two center positions are the most likely
culprits. Depending on your BPM, 1-2 beats is fine.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Example | Explanation |
| :-: | :- |
| ![Vision block example](/.assets/images/mapping/vb_example.png) | In this example, I have my max beats set to 2 beats<br />At beat 150 there are facenotes blocking everything behind them. At beats 151 and 151.5 there are highlighted red and blue blocks indicating that the previous blocks are a problem.<br />You have two options:<br />_Move/delete the top two blocks (removing the vision block)<br />_ Move the back two blocks further out in time so the player has a chance to react to them |

### Stats Panel

When you're ready, click the Stat Panel button to open an incredibly helpful information window.
You can get information by hovering over each title.

::: tip

- Use <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+scroll to select a section you want to check the stats for, hit <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>TAB</kbd>
  and click the <kbd>Stats Panel</kbd> button to see values for that section only.
- Hover over the **NPS** value to see the difficulty ranges for OST 1 tracks.
  Consult the [Beat Saber Map Analysis](https://officialmech.github.io/bs-analysis/ost/data) tracker
  for the latest (and greatly increased) NPS ranges of **all** base game maps.
  :::

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Example | Explanation |
| :-: | :- |
| ![Stats panel screenshot](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-stats-panel.png) | **Notes:** The total number of notes in your map.<br />**Notes per Second:** The number of notes in your map divided by the number of seconds in your map. This number isn't accurate until you've finished mapping, unless you've only selected a small section.<br />**Bombs, Walls, and Lighting:** The number of each event you have in your map.<br />**R/B Ratio:** If you have exactly the same number of red and blue blocks this will be 1.00. Greater than 1 you have more reds. Less than 1 you have more blues.<br />**Vision Block:** The percentage of your map's blocks that are vision blocks at 0.75 beats. Use the vision block checker to highlight these blocks.<br />**Vision Block (A):** The percentage of your map's blocks that are vision blocks at 1.25 beats. Useful for faster songs. Use the vision block checker with a max time of 1.25 to highlight these blocks.<br />**Top/Middle/Bottom Notes:** The percentage of your blocks that are placed in each row. |

## Troubleshooting

### **Create Level button does nothing even if a song name is entered**

- [Check both folder paths](#check-the-wip-file-path) are complete on the Song Selection screen and add the path(s) from
  [First Time Setup](#first-time-setup) if blank.
  There is a known bug that deletes the CustomWIPLevels folder path on first use.
- Make sure the Song Name field below the button is not blank/has text.
- Make sure you are launching the editor from the extracted folder, not the zip (MMA2.zip) you downloaded.

---

### **My song is stuck loading in the editor forever or returns to the edit song screen after briefly loading**

- This error is usually caused by a missing, corrupted, or invalid audio file. Re-read [Basic Audio Setup](./basic-audio.md)
  to ensure you've exported everything correctly and make sure that your file is in the correct folder.
  Usage of convert to OGG websites is the common cause of this issue.
- The audio file is not in the correct location. Make sure it is in the folder that MMA2 created for your song!
  - The folder you should put the `.ogg` song file is located to the path you put during [First Time Setup](#first-time-setup)
    and should contain at least an `Info.dat` file.
- Make sure you are launching the editor from the extracted folder, not the zip (MMA2.zip) you downloaded.

---

### **I can't figure out how to place dot notes**

- Press `F`
  - You can review the keybindings by pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> for the in-editor list or consult the
    cross-reference list of [Editor Keybinds](./editor-keybinds.md).

---

### **Map doesn't load in game**

- This error is caused by incorrect information in the `Info.dat`.
  - A difficulty's `"_beatmapFilename"` in the `Info.dat` might be using a
    different file name than what is present in the folder.
  - A deleted difficulty is still being referenced in your `Info.dat` file.
    - Check to make sure you do not have unintended difficulties in the
      `"_difficultyBeatmaps"` cluster of each present characteristc.

---

### **One Saber maps don't load in game**

- Update to the latest MMA2 on the [BSMG Git](https://git.bsmg.wiki/Top_Cat/MediocreMapAssistant2/releases/latest)
  then open the map [song info settings](#song-info-settings) and press `Save song info`.

---

### **No Arrows maps don't load in game**

- Update to the latest MMA2 on the [BSMG Git](https://git.bsmg.wiki/Top_Cat/MediocreMapAssistant2/releases/latest)
  then open the map [song info settings](#song-info-settings) and press `Save song info`.

---

### **90/360 maps don't use the Glass Desert Environment**

- Open the map's Info.dat in a text editor and add `"_allDirectionsEnvironmentName": "GlassDesertEnvironment",` after
  `"_environmentName": "DefaultEnvironment",` or similar if you set a different environment for other difficulties.

:::tip
If you are not comfortable editing the Info.dat, you can zip up your map and use
[Schema Fixer](https://skystudioapps.com/mapping-tools/#schema-fixer)
by **+1 Rabbit** to make the one time adjustment!
:::

---

### **Your audio file name is wrong. Enter only the name NOT the path.**

![Audio File Name Wrong](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2-wrongPath.png)

- You might have unintentionally named your audio file `song.ogg.ogg`. Turn on file extensions in file explorer to make
  sure it is named `song.ogg`. The option is located here:  
  ![Turn on File Extensions](/.assets/images/mapping/turnOnFileExtend.png)

- [Check both folder paths](#check-the-wip-file-path) are complete on the Song Selection screen and add the path(s) from
  [First Time Setup](#first-time-setup) if blank. There is a known bug that deletes the CustomWIPLevels folder path on
  first use.
- Your audio file name contains extra periods `.`
  - For example `Sick Beats feat. CMB (Nightcore Ver.).ogg` will cause this issue due to the `.` after "feat" and "Ver".
    - To prevent this in the future, it is easier to name your audio files `song.ogg`.
    - You can also rename the audio file removing the extra `.` for example, `Sick Beats feat CMB (Nightcore Ver).ogg`
- Your audio file may be invalid. This is commonly caused by websites that promise to "convert to OGG" but do not do it
  properly. Review [Basic Audio Setup](./basic-audio.md) to ensure you've exported everything correctly and that your
  file is in the correct folder.

---

### **When I open the editor, all I see is a grid and block and can't interact with it**

![Broken Editor](/.assets/images/mapping/mma2BrokenApp.png)

- Navigate to your `\AppData\Local` and delete the `MediocreMapAssistant2` folder. Then run `mediocremapassistant2.exe`
  and follow [First Time Setup](#first-time-setup) again.
  - You can copy and paste this path into the file explorer address bar to quickly get to the folder: `C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\MediocreMapAssistant2`
