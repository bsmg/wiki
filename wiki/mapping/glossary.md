| **Stagger** | A [Slider](#s) placed with the spacing between [Blocks](#b) too large for the player to hit in one motion. This is considered a [Mismap](#m).

| **Staircase** | A [Pattern](#p) where a [Block](#s)'s direction points towards the following block. This does not include blocks on the same beat. Can be a potential [Hitbox](#h) issue where a block is placed in the post-swing of a previous block. <details><summary>**Example Image**</summary>![Picture of staircase](~@images/mapping/staircase.jpg)</details> |
| **Stream** | A steady, sustained [Pattern](#p) of [Notes](#n), typically at 1/4 [Precision](#p). <details><summary>**Example Image**</summary>![Picture of stream](~@images/mapping/stream.png)</details> |
