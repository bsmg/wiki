# Advanced Mapping

:::warning NOTE
If you are looking to begin mapping, please start by reading the [Basic Mapping](./basic-mapping.md) page.

If you know the basics and are looking for a complete overview of all the important mapping topics,
check the [Intermediate Mapping](./intermediate-mapping.md) page.
:::

This page is a collection of individual detailed guides on specific topics from an advanced perspective and does not have
a straightforward structure as the previous mapping pages. Feel free to skip around between the topics that interest you
the most.

If you think you have some wisdom to share about something you are a master of, please consider contributing by
modifying the existing pages or adding a new one.

## Advanced Timing

### Variable BPM Songs

If, while mapping, you notice that your song was properly aligned but suddenly changes or starts to fall off beat,
then it's likely a BPM issue.

If the alignment suddenly and dramatically shifts for large parts of the song, but it seems consistent, it is likely
your map has multiple BPMs. Depending on how often it occurs, this is relatively easy to fix. You can simply cut the
map up into pieces where the grid becomes unaligned, and then run each one through
[Arrow Vortex](./basic-audio.md#sync-using-arrow-vortex) to find the correct BPM for each part. You can then use BPM
blocks to readjust the grid to align to the beat.

However, if the grid is less consistent and drifts around being aligned with no dramatic changes, then it is likely your
song has a drifting BPM. This is common in older songs. This can be more of a hassle to deal with, but it is possible to
address. Please see the [variable BPM guide](./advanced-audio.md#variable-bpm) for more information.

### Swing In a Song and How Shuffle Helps

See this guide by Sykes
[What swing is, and how "shuffle" will make your mapping easier](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j7w1X-0QtnJDFVKzyyQc_KR7RE9H3C3JFesIXGR0s1c/edit)
on how to use the built in shuffle feature to make mapping songs that have swing easier.

## Momentum Mapping

There is knowledge written and discussed that is not completely included in the
[momentum section](./intermediate-mapping.md#momentum-and-tension) of the Intermediate Mapping page.
However, nobody has yet spent the time presenting it in this page. For now, feel free to use what is written there.
