# Advanced Mapping

If you are looking to begin mapping, please start by reading the [Basic Mapping](./basic-mapping.md) page.

If you know the basics and are looking for a complete overview of all the important mapping topics, check the [Intermediate Mapping](./intermediate-mapping.md) page.

This page is and will probably always be *incomplete*, and instead contain a collection of individual detailed guides on specific topics from an advanced perspective.
If you think you have some wisdom to share about something you are a master of, please consider contributing by modifying the existing pages or adding a new one.

## Advanced Timing

In the [Advanced Timing](./advanced-timing.md) page you will find details on topics like variable BPM, Swing, etc.

## Momentum Mapping

[Momentum mapping](./momentum-mapping.md) is a principled and technical approach to producing maps with good flow, specially tech maps.
