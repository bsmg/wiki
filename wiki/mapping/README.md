## Mapping Quick Start
> The wiki is your building blocks, the community is your inspiration, and you are the creativity.  

Great mappers are not made in a day. It takes dedication with no one really able to hold your hand. The best we can do
is provide you the tools with this wiki and clarify any questions you have to succeed in your mapping career!

1. Download the necessary tools for mapping: an [audio editor](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and a [map editor](#map-editing-resources).
2. [Set up your audio file](#audio-editing-resources), find and confirm the BPM, and export in OGG format.
3. Set up your song in your mapping editor (steps vary by editor but here's the
  [user guide](./mediocre-map-assistant.md) for MMA2).
4. Get mapping! Review [basic mapping practices](./basic-mapping.md) before you start.
  [Playtest](#playtesting) your own work early and often while mapping.
5. Get lighting! Review [basic lighting information](#lighting-practices). Simple manual lighting is easier than you think!
6. Get your map [playtested](#playtesting)! Third-party playtesting via the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)
  is highly recommended to get constructive feedback and to get past your own "map blindness."
7. Once your song has been mapped, lighted, and playtested you’re ready to [release](#publishing-songs)
  your song to the world on BeatSaver.

## Audio Editing Resources
Before mapping, you need to get your audio file ready so that it works with your map editor. This section will walk you
through how to set up and edit your audio file using a free program called [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).

### [**Basic Audio Setup**](./basic-audio.md)
Can't make a map without audio. Learn how to setup your audio for easy mapping!

### [**Advanced Audio Editing**](./advanced-audio.md)
A deeper dive in adjusting audio files such as making shorter versions or working with variable BPM.

## Map Editing Resources

### Community Editors
::: warning
Community editors often have more features and don't require a VR headset, but they can be buggy, so use with caution.
:::
Keyboard shortcuts for these editors are available inside their respective in-editor menus with a cross-reference between
all of them [available here](./editor-keybinds.md).

#### ChroMapper
**Now in open beta!** A 3D editor that has stellar support for lighting, Chroma, Noodle Extensions, 360/90 mapping, and
shares similar assets with Beat Saber, allowing for a
more accurate preview. By FAR the most feature-rich editor available to the community.

Joining the [ChroMapper Discord](https://discord.gg/wFjZt4z) is encouraged to access plugins, scripts, and application
support (mapping support is available in BSMG).

* [ChroMapper Launcher Download](https://cm.topc.at/dl)
* [ChroMapper Wiki](https://chromapper.atlassian.net/wiki)

#### Mediocre Map Assistant 2
MMA2 was used by the majority of the mapping community until the ChroMapper open beta.

* [Mediocre Map Assistant 2 Download](https://git.bsmg.wiki/Top_Cat/MediocreMapAssistant2/releases/latest)
* [Mediocre Map Assistant 2 User Guide](./mediocre-map-assistant.md)

#### Beatmapper.app
A 3D editor that runs in the browser, allowing anyone with a web browser to map. It works best for standard mapping without
any extensions, but new features are being added.

* [Beatmapper Website](https://beatmapper.app/)
* [Beatmapper User Manual](https://beatmapper.app/docs/manual/getting-started)

::: tip Interested in making your own editor or converter?
You may find the [Map Format Page](./map-format.md) and the
[SongCore Readme](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore/blob/master/README.md) helpful!
:::

### Official Editor
The official editor is developed and supported by Beat Games and pre-installed with the Steam VR or Oculus PC versions
of Beat Saber. It makes playtesting convenient with one-click access to your work-in-progress in-game. The official editor
is 2D and requires good visualization skills to translate well to a 3D play space, which can be challenging for new
mappers. The vast majority of mappers use a [Community Editor](#community-editors).  

* To access, launch the editor from within Beat Saber in your HMD
  or use fpfc launch parameters to open directly from your PC
* Check out Megalon's [Official Editor Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ex6sOEVgrM)
  for an overview of standard mapping!

Keep in mind the following features that official does not have compared to the [Community Editors](#community-editors) available.

* Uncommon Precision such as 1/5 and associated multiples.
* Regular autosave and recovery (Editor only autosaves when testing or saving)
* Flexible mass select, copy, and paste
* Edit in place (Change the direction of notes without needing to delete)
* Chroma Support
* Actual audio offset for syncing. (The parameter in official offsets/delays not only the song but also hitsounds)
* Error Checker
* Contributor Fields
* Mapping or Noodle Extensions Support

#### Migrating from Official Editor to a Community Editor
Although it is recommended to start setup again following the [Quick Start](#mapping-quick-start) guides with a
[Community Editor](#community-editors), it is possible to transfer your work in the Official Editor over.

1. Install a [Community Editor](#community-editors)
2. Locate your map files in your game's `CustomLevels` folder.
    * Steam Example Location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
    * Oculus Example Location: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
3. Move it to the folder your editor is looking in. This is commonly the `CustomWIPLevels` in the `Beat Saber_Data` folder.
    * Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`
    * Oculus: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels`
4. Convert your audio file to the `.ogg` format from `.wav` if you have not done so.
    1. Download and Install [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)
    2. Open the `.wav` file in Audacity
    2. Click the `File menu -> Export -> Export as OGG.`
    3. Name your file `song.ogg` and click <kbd>Save</kbd>.
    4. Place the `song.ogg` file into the map folder.
        * You no longer need the `.wav` song file in this folder
5. Open the map in the community editor and change the song file name to `song.ogg` and click the save button.

You are now ready to continue editing your map!

## Mapping Practices
> "You have to know the rules before you can break them."  
> \- Uninstaller

There is no holy bible of mapping but this section of the wiki includes a lot of tribal knowledge from the community on
best practices at all levels of mapping. Our advice is to follow these rules until you're comfortable with your skills
and then get creative, experiment, and innovate!

### [**Basic Mapping**](./basic-mapping.md)
All new mappers need to read this, **no exceptions!**

### [**Intermediate Mapping**](./intermediate-mapping.md)
A more in-depth look at many mapping topics

### [**Extended Mapping**](./extended-mapping.md)
Mapping Extensions, Extra Characteristics, and 360&deg;/90&deg; mapping

### Mapper Roles
To apply for the **Mapper** role on the [Beat Saber Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) you must have
released three solid/playable maps (collaborations are acceptable) and complete the
[Mapper Role Submission Form](https://forms.gle/mj66J3UopTykFJjXA). Your application and maps may take a decent amount of
time to be reviewed and approved.

### Curation
Mappers can submit high quality maps, free of [objective issues](https://bsaber.com/getting-started/curation/#donts) to
the #curation-request channel on the [BeastSaber Discord](https://discord.gg/VJZHUbt). Maps selected for curation are
given extra visibility on the site and included in the Curator Recommended feed.

### Modding & Ranking
Maps that meet specific [Ranking Criteria](https://scoresaber.com/criteria) and go through an intensive review process called
"modding" have the potential to become ranked, awarding players Performance Points (PP) toward global leaderboards. More
information and an in-depth FAQ is available on the [ScoreSaber Discord](https://discord.gg/WpuDMwU)

* Prior to requesting ranking, mappers should thoroughly review the ranking criteria and
  [metadata standards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehotupIYMVlc8x41JldO-24m7Am-oTVYnciF9KCRdNM/edit)
  and have their map modded by a knowledgeable source.

:::tip Want an even more detailed look?
Review the [Ranking Criteria](https://scoresaber.com/criteria) for some of the more ambiguous ranking considerations.
:::

* Once your map has been modded and revised, it’s ready to be presented to a ranking team member or recruit to review.
* If the ranking team member deems the map acceptable it will be added to the ranking request queue to be voted
  on by the full ranking team.
  
### Mapping Anxiety
If you're finding it difficult to muster up the courage to upload your map, or are finding it emotionally taxing coping
with a lack of downloads or a lot of dislikes, you're not alone. Many mappers have experienced these feelings. You can read
more about it on the [Coping with Mapping Anxiety](./mapping-anxiety.md) page.

## Lighting Practices
A map is not finished until some form of lighting is included.
Lighting can range from very basic to incredibly detailed using additional mods to enable more features.

### [**Basic Lighting**](./basic-lighting.md)
Learn the various aspects to lighting your map manually

### [**Intermediate Lighting**](./intermediate-lighting.md)
Take your lighting skills a bit further into strobing, ring spins, and contrast practices

### [**Advanced Lighting**](./advanced-lighting.md)
Advanced and nuanced techniques, lighting for custom platforms, and Chroma RGB **(This page is still a work in progress!)**

### Automated Lights
Not ready to make your own lighting? Here are some programs to do it for you. Keep in mind, creating simple manual lighting
is not difficult and will always be better at expressing the atmosphere of the song than using these programs.

* [Lolighter](https://github.com/Loloppe/Lolighter#readme) by **Loloppe#6435** - Standalone program for automated lighting
  and has other features to modify your map.
* **Lightmap** - It is integrated into Mediocre Map Assistant 2 and can be accessed in the error checker menu.

## Playtesting
Testing your work is a **critical** part of mapping. Testing as you work helps you adjust for major playability issues and
get a feel for your map. [Third-party or "outside"](#community-third-party-testing) playtesting is when someone other than
yourself tests your pre-release map and provides constructive feedback and is helpful in highlighting issues to which you
may be "map blind."

::: danger
You **DO NOT** need to upload your map to BeatSaver in order for you or anyone else to test.
:::

* If your map is using the 1.0 song format (your files are .json and .ogg) you must convert your map using one of several
  available tools like [Songe Converter](https://github.com/lolPants/songe-converter) by lolPants or
  [BeatMapper Tools](https://mappers.beatmappertools.com/) by Darkuni.
  **Update your editor to MMA2 or Beatmapper**. See [Community Editors](.#community-editors) for links.
* If your map is using the 2.0 song format (your files are .dat and .ogg/.egg) you’re ready to test.

### Testing on a PC
Follow these steps to test any of your maps made with a community editor using PC-based VR.

1. If your WIP song folder isn’t already in `Beat Saber_Data\CustomWIPLevels` then place a copy there.
2. Access your map in-game via the CustomWIPLevels category in the song pack menu. Use practice mode to play
  (the button next to the play button).

**Made changes to your map while the game is open?**  
Click on the game window. Then while you are on the Main Menu or Song Select Menu press <kbd>Ctrl + r</kbd> on your keyboard.
Your changes will be loaded without needing to restart the game!

:::tip NOTE

* You will need to have the **SongCore** mod installed in order to see the CustomWIPLevels category and use the
  <kbd>Ctrl + r</kbd> shortcut.
* Having duplicate map files in `CustomLevels` and `CustomWIPLevels` can cause problems.
* Using Online Websites to convert audio to `.ogg` may result in your audio file being treated as invalid and will not be
  loaded by the game! Using Audacity and following the steps in [Basic Audio Setup](./basic-audio.md) is the easiest way
  to ensure your map loads in-game.
:::  

### Testing on a Quest
Follow these steps to test any of your maps made with a community editor using an Oculus Quest. You must have
[SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) and [BMBF](https://bmbf.dev/stable) installed.

1. Zip up the song as normal, only zipping the files and not the folder itself. [How to Video](https://streamable.com/u20ci)
   * If you are using [MMA2](#mediocre-map-assistant-2) there is a `Package To Zip` button you can use
    in the song info screen to do this for you.
2. Establish a connection to your Quest from your PC. This can be done in two ways, [wired](#connect-wired-usb) and [wirelessly](#connect-wirelessly).

#### Connect Wirelessly

1. Open BMBF on the Oculus Quest. BMBF must be running for the connection to succeed.
2. Inside BMBF go to the `Tools` tab. There you should see a web address and a version number similar to what is shown below.
  <br/>![ip](~@images/mapping/ip.png)
3. Open a modern web browser on your PC and type the address into the search bar. You should be greeted with this screen
  below.<br/>![BMBF Web](~@images/mapping/bmbfweb.png)
4. You are now connected! Continue on to the [Upload Test File to Quest](#upload-test-file-to-quest) steps below.

#### Connect Wired USB

1. Connect your Oculus Quest to the PC via USB and keep SideQuest open
2. Open BMBF on the Oculus Quest. BMBF must be running for the connection to succeed
3. Look at the top of SideQuest, which will give you the IP to get into BMBF. You can also access your IP through
  the Tools tab of BMBF.
4. Type into any web browser: "192.168.X.XXX:50000" with X being replaced with the IP displayed in SideQuest,
  or the Tools tab<br/>![Quest IP](~@images/mapping/quest_ip.png)  
  For example, from the picture you would enter `192.168.0.19:50000` into a web browser of choice (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
5. You are now connected! Continue on to the [Upload Test File to Quest](#upload-test-file-to-quest) steps below.

#### Upload Test File to Quest

1. Drag and drop the files into BMBF's upload page (indicated by /main/upload at the end of the link)
2. Once uploaded, click Sync to Beat Saber at the top right corner of the page
  <br/>![BMBF Browser](~@images/mapping/bmbf_browser.png)
3. Access your map in-game via the Custom Songs playlist in the song pack menu. Use practice mode to play
  (the button next to the play button).

:::tip NOTE

* If after deleting an old copy of a map and reuploading it with a new version on a quest still results with the old
  version being played, rename the zip file before uploading it through BMBF.
* BMBF may have issues importing your map if your song file or cover image name contains `-` or spaces. You may need to
  rename these files and update the song info accordingly for a successful upload.
* Using Online Websites to convert audio to `.ogg` may result in your audio file being treated as invalid and will not be
  loaded by BMBF! Using Audacity and following the steps in [Basic Audio Setup](./basic-audio.md) is the easiest way to
  ensure your map loads in-game.
* If your song audio file was automatically converted to `.egg`, you may run into issues when uploading onto BMBF.
  Try renaming the `.egg` back to `.ogg`.
:::

### Community / Third Party Testing
The `#testplays` channel in the [Beat Saber Modding Group Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) makes it easy to have
your work checked by knowledgeable mappers. Playtesters will provide constructive feedback on how to improve your map in
either video or text format in a DM or in the `#mapping-discussion` channel.

:::warning Some things to note...

* Maps with less than 1 minute done will not get much feedback or be tested.
  Consider asking in `#mapping-discussion` to see if someone will take a look instead.
* Challenge/Super High difficulty maps may take longer to get feedback since there are
  not many playtesters at this skill level.
* Please keep to serious posts where you are looking to improve your mapping skills.
  Meme or Shitpost maps do not belong as they end up wasting the testplayers time.
:::

1. Create a compressed .zip file of the individual song files.
    * If you are using [MMA2](./mediocre-map-assistant.md), you can press the `Package Song to Zip` button in the Song Info
    Settings to create a compressed .zip of your map.  
    ![Package Song to Zip button](~@images/mapping/mma2-package-zip.jpg)  
    * If you are using [Beatmapper.app](#beatmapper-app), follow their [downloading instructions](https://beatmapper.app/docs/manual/publishing#downloading-your-map).
    * You can manually create the zip by following this [How to Video](https://streamable.com/u20ci) if you are not using
     a web based editor.
2. Upload your map to `#testplays` using the following format:  

* **Map:** The name and artist of your map  
* **Length:** The length of the song  
* **BPM:** The BPM of the song  
* **Difficulty:** Which difficulties are included
* **NPS:** The notes per second of each difficulty available  
* **Feedback:** Any requests for feedback (specific difficulties to be tested, things to look for etc.)  
* **Status:** What state is the map in?
  (i.e., First draft complete, no lights; 1:45 mapped; release candidate w/ lighting; etc.)

3. Testers will usually look at your map within 1-7 days and will use a number of reaction emojis
  (listed in `#testplays` pinned posts) to track testing status.

:::warning Remember: If you make changes after posting or getting feedback
React with a 🛑 `:octagonal_sign:` to indicate stop testing this version
:::

You can copy and paste the following template into Discord:

```txt
**Map:**
**Length:**
**BPM:**
**Difficulty:**
**NPS:**
**Feedback:**
**Status:**
```

### Help Playtest
Do you like the idea of playing new songs before they are ever released on BeatSaver? Do you want to help shape the
 mapping community? Consider becoming a testplayer! Check out the [How to Testplay](./how-to-testplay.md) guide to get started!

## Publishing Songs
Once your song has been mapped, lighted, and playtested and it’s a finished product you’re ready to release it to the world!

### BeatSaver
[BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/) is the public repository for all custom Beat Saber maps.

#### How to Release a Map

::: danger

* Please **DO NOT** upload an incomplete WIP map to BeatSaver!  
  * Uploading to BeatSaver equates to "Putting it on the store shelf" and should **only** be your final version.  
  * See the [Playtesting](#playtesting) section for instructions on testing your map.
:::

1. [Create an account](https://beatsaver.com/register) on BeatSaver with a username/password or by logging in via Discord.
    * Beatsaver usernames may only have alphanumeric characters and `-`. Usernames with spaces or `_` for example, are
    not allowed.
2. Click the <kbd>Upload</kbd> link in the top-right.
3. Add your BeatSaver map name and map description. Only the map name is searchable so be sure to include song name,
  song artist, and other terms that might make it easier to find your map.
    * Use "tags" like (Chroma), (OneSaber), or (Mapping Extensions) if your map uses some special modifications or
      characteristics you want to highlight.
    * Putting a link to a playthrough video in the map description can help you get more downloads as it is easier
      to share your map to others and lets people know what to expect.
4. Add your .zip file and identify whether your map was human-made or AI-assisted.
    * AI maps intentionally uploaded as human-made will be deleted.
5. Maps are initially uploaded to your unpublished tab. You must explicitly publish them to make them available to the public.

::: tip NOTE
Map files can now be updated on BeatSaver!
If you need to upload a new version of your map you must first recall the map to your unpublished tab before you can
upload a new version. This will retain your map key and statistics but will reset all leaderboards.
:::

### BeatSaver Troubleshooting
Here are solutions for some common errors when uploading a Beatmap.  
Encountered something not listed here? Drop into `#mapping-discussion` for assistance.

:::danger Remember:

* You should have your map [playtested](#playtesting) before uploading!  
* You do not need upload maps created by auto-generation software such as Deepsaber or Beat Sage to install them in your
 game. If you are on PC, you can unzip the files into your `CustomLevels` folder. If you are on Quest, follow the
 [Testing on a Quest](#testing-on-a-quest) steps to install the map.

* A difficulty's `"_beatmapFilename"` in the `Info.dat` might be using a different
  file name than what is present in the folder.  
* A deleted difficulty is still being referenced in your `Info.dat` file.
  Check to make sure you do not have unintended difficulties in the `"_difficultyBeatmaps"` cluster of each present characteristic.
