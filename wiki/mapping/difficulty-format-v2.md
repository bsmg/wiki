description: Take a deep dive into the v2 difficulty file format for a Beat Saber map.
---

# Difficulty File (v2)

Each Difficulty Beatmap contains a corresponding file which defines the notes, obstacles, events,
and other objects for that particular difficulty.

## v2 Base Object

```json
{
  "_version": "2.6.0",
  "_notes": [],
  "_sliders": [], // Introduced in version 2.6.0
  "_obstacles": [],
  "_events": [],
  "_waypoints": [], // Introduced in version 2.2.0
  "_customData": {
    // Any custom data will go here.
    // If empty, this should be removed entirely.
  }
}
```

### \_version

### \_sliders

This is an array of [Slider](#sliders-3) objects for the map.

### \_obstacles

This is an array of [Obstacle](#obstacles-3) objects for the map.

### \_events

This is an array of [Event](#events-1) objects for the map.

### \_waypoints

::: tip NOTE
This is a stub section.
:::
This is used to control BTS TinyTAN figures. Some information can be found in this
[document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1spW7LS-RvenLQBVXJl9w_iOwqr9r_ozxYo3JUlXq9Lc).

### \_customData

This is an optional field that contains data unrelated to the official Beat Saber level format.
If no custom data exists, this object should be removed entirely.

The exact specifics of what goes in `_customData` is entirely dependent on community-created content that needs them.
As such, we cannot list all `_customData` fields here. You will have to do your own searching throughout the Beat Saber
community to find map editors, tools, or mods that use this `_customData` object.

    // Any custom data will go here.
    // If empty, this should be removed entirely.
  }
}
```

### \_time

The time, in beats, where this object reaches the player.

| `_type` | Name                          | Type                   |
| :-----: | ----------------------------- | ---------------------- |

|  `100`  | V2 BPM Changes                | BPM / Unused (V3)      |

:::danger
Just because an event type is listed as unused, does _not_ mean you are freely available to use it!

Beat Games is known to repurpose previously unused event types for certain features, such as the introduction of 360&deg;
/ 90&deg; levels. This has broken some Beat Saber maps that make use of legacy MediocreMapper BPM Changes, as well as maps
that used Custom Platforms that took advantage of the unused event types.
:::

### \_value

Depending on the aforementioned [`_type`](#type-2) of the event, the `_value` of it can do different things.

#### Controlling Lights

It's most common behavior is controlling brightness and color of lights, and follows this table:

| `_value` | Type       | Effect                                                                                |
| :------: | :--------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `0`    | Off        | Turns the light group off.                                                            |
|   `1`    | On         | Changes the lights to blue, and turns the lights on.                                  |
|   `2`    | Flash      | Changes the lights to blue, and flashes brightly before returning to normal.          |
|   `3`    | Fade       | Changes the lights to blue, and flashes brightly before fading to black.              |
|   `4`    | Transition | (Previously Unused.)<br/>Changes the lights to blue by fading from the current state. |
|   `5`    | On         | Changes the lights to red, and turns the lights on.                                   |
|   `6`    | Flash      | Changes the lights to red, and flashes brightly before returning to normal.           |
|   `7`    | Fade       | Changes the lights to red, and flashes brightly before fading to black.               |
|   `8`    | Transition | Changes the lights to red by fading from the current state.                           |
|   `9`    | On         | Changes the lights to white, and turns the lights on.                                 |
|   `10`   | Flash      | Changes the lights to white, and flashes brightly before returning to normal.         |
|   `11`   | Fade       | Changes the lights to white, and flashes brightly before fading to black.             |
|   `12`   | Transition | Changes the lights to white by fading from the current state.                         |

`_value` 4 and 8 were introduced in Beat Saber version `1.18.0` (Billie Eilish patch). These transition events will only
transition from off, on, or other transition events. They will do nothing if the previous event is a fade or flash event.

`_value` 9, 10, 11, and 12 were introduced in Beat Saver version `1.22.0` (Electronic Mixtape patch).

#### Controlling Triggers

Triggers, most notably Ring Spin and Ring Zoom, ignore `_value`.

Ring Spin usually causes an object to spin to a random position. Ring Zoom
usually toggles an object between two states.

Events 16 and 17 in Interscope, which control car hydraulics, are triggers.

#### Controlling Laser Rotation Speed

When the event is used to control laser speed for a group of lights, the `_value`
is used as a multiplier to their base rotational velocity.

If `_value` is `0`, the random rotation offset for each laser will also be reset,
causing all rotating lasers to line up perfectly.

#### Controlling Position

When the event is used to control position of an object, the `_value`
is used as a multiplier to their base position increment.

Coil heights (Event 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 and 19) in Gaga and Ring Zoom
(Event 9) in The Second are examples of position controls.

#### Controlling Cars

In Interscope environment, Event 8 (Ring Spin) controls cars. The effect of
`_value` is as follows.

| `value` | Effect                                            |
| :-----: | ------------------------------------------------- |
|   `0`   | Affects all the cars. Does not affect hydraulics. |
|   `1`   | Affects all the cars.                             |
|   `2`   | Affects the left cars.                            |
|   `3`   | Affects the right cars.                           |
|   `4`   | Affects the front-most cars.                      |
|   `5`   | Affects the front-middle cars.                    |
|   `6`   | Affects the back-middle cars.                     |
|   `7`   | Affects the back-most cars.                       |

#### Controlling Boost Colors

| `_value` | Effect                                                            |
| :------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `0`    | Turns the event off - switches to first (default) pair of colors. |
|   `1`    | Turns the event on - switches to second pair of colors.           |

#### Controlling 360/90 Rotation

When the event is used to control rotation in a 360/90 degree level, the `_value`
is used to add rotation equal to the following table:

| `_value` | Effect                      |
| :------: | --------------------------- |
|   `0`    | 60 Degrees Counterclockwise |
|   `1`    | 45 Degrees Counterclockwise |
|   `2`    | 30 Degrees Counterclockwise |
|   `3`    | 15 Degrees Counterclockwise |
|   `4`    | 15 Degrees Clockwise        |
|   `5`    | 30 Degrees Clockwise        |
|   `6`    | 45 Degrees Clockwise        |
|   `7`    | 60 Degrees Clockwise        |

#### V1 Official BPM Changes

When the event is used to control the BPM, the `_value` represents the new BPM.

The new BPM does not shift internal [`_time`](#time-2) values for future objects. Instead, it essentially recalculates
internal game values (Such as Half Jump Duration and Jump Distance) to match the effect of playing the map at the new BPM.

One caveat to this is that the `_value` must _always_ be an integer, and does not support floating point numbers (No decimals).

:::danger NOTE
This event cannot be used with V2 and V3 lighting; the ID for this event
has since been repurposed for extra lights.

[Event 100](#official-bpm-changes) for V2 and [BPM Events](#bpm-events)
for V3 should be used instead.
:::

:::warning
As of Beat Saber `1.10.0`, V1 Official BPM Changes are broken, and
produce unwanted effects when used in a level.

If you absolutely want to work around this, you must create a new V1 BPM Change event so that:

1. This new event _must_ have the same exact [`_time`](#time-2) as the
   V1 BPM Change event you want to trigger correctly.
2. This new event _must_ have the same `_value` as the previous BPM Change,
   or the [`_beatsPerMinute`](#beatsperminute) defined in [`Info.dat`](#info-dat).
3. This new event _must_ occur before the BPM Change you want to trigger correctly,
   _even if they share the same [`_time`](#time-2) values._
   :::

Depending on the aforementioned [`_type`](#type-2) of the event, the `_floatValue` of it can do different things.

#### Controlling Lights

When the event is used to control lights, the `_floatValue` determines the brightness of the light.

#### Official BPM Changes

When the event is used to control the BPM, the `_floatValue` represents the new BPM.

This will also alter the Note Jump Speed proportional to the change in BPM prior to Beat Saber version 1.20.0.

### \_customData

This is an optional field that contains data unrelated to the official Beat Saber level format.
If no custom data exists, this object should be removed entirely.

The exact specifics of what goes in `_customData` is entirely dependent on community-created content that needs them.
As such, we cannot list all `_customData` fields here. You will have to do your own searching throughout the Beat Saber
community to find map editors, tools, or mods that use this `_customData` object.
