# Making Mods

Beat Saber _**does not**_ have built in mod support.

Development for [PC](#pc-mod-development) and [Quest standalone](#quest-mod-development) are two vastly different workflows.

## PC Mod Development

If you want to make mods for the PC version of the game, the following guide will cover a multitude of different
processes involved in making mods from scratch, as well as some of the different APIs you have access to.

Visit the [PC Mod Development](./pc/index.md) page to begin.

## Quest Mod Development

The following guide covers most of the concepts you will need for creating mods for the Quest. This includes but is not
limited to:

- Hooking
- Configuration using `config-utils`
- User Interfaces using `bsml`
- Custom types

Visit the [Quest Mod Development Intro](./quest/intro.md) page for more information on getting started!
