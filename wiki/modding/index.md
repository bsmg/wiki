# Making Mods

Beat Saber _**does not**_ have built in mod support.

Development for [PC](#pc-mod-development) and [Quest standalone](#quest-mod-development) are two vastly different workflows.

## PC Mod Development

### Injecting Mods

Instead, most mods within the mod installer rely on
[BSIPA (Beat Saber Illusion Plugin Architecture)](https://github.com/nike4613/BeatSaber-IPA-Reloaded/)
to inject plugins into the game, as well as providing some useful tools for us modders.

For those of you who prefer [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) over either of these options, Bepis has created
a loader for BSIPA plugins, available [here](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.BSIPA.Loader). As for developing Beat Saber
plugins with the BepInEx plugin API, a generic guide exists on their
[documentation site](https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/v5.0/articles/dev_guide/plugin_tutorial/index.html),
but other than that you're kinda on your own.

### Project Setup

If you are interested in creating a Beat Saber mod, but do not have a template or Visual Studio template set up,
[follow the Intro guide to get your project all set up](./pc-mod-dev-intro.md).

#### Ready to go?

Check out the [links below](#other-links) for documentation relating to Unity and related tooling. If you have any questions,
the best place to ask is in the `#pc-mod-dev` channel on the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)

### Launch args

Helpful launch arguments that will make modding / debugging easier.

| Argument&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--verbose`                                                                                  | Enables the output log window for IPA. This will show the debug console that mods use.                                                                                                                    |
| `fpfc`                                                                                       | "First Person Flying Controller"<br /><br />This allows you to use WASD and the mouse to navigate around the menu in game. This makes testing much easier, because you don't have to put on your headset! |
| `-vrmode oculus`                                                                             | If you are running Beat Saber through Steam, this allows you to play the game on an Oculus headset.                                                                                                       |
