# Quest User Interface

UI is used by many mods to show configuration options. In this section, we'll show you how to use `bsml` to create a
settings screen for your mod using code. `bsml` also supports creating UI with xml which can be found on the [BSML docs](https://redbrumbler.github.io/Quest-BSML-Docs/).

## Prerequisites

- Install `bsml` by running `qpm dependency add bsml` in your project directory.
- You also need to install `custom-types` even if you don't use it in your mod: `qpm dependency add custom-types`

Make sure to restore after adding the dependencies.

## Creating a `DidActivate` method

`DidActivate` is a method you can register with `bsml` that allows you to make a simple mod settings page.

Take a look at this example:

- You should only create your components on first activation to prevent duplication.
- You can utilize containers (such as Scrollable, HorizontalLayout and VerticalLayout) to manipulate the locations of components.

```cpp
#include "bsml/shared/BSML.hpp"

void DidActivate(HMUI::ViewController* self, bool firstActivation, bool addedToHierarchy, bool screenSystemEnabling) {
    // Create our UI elements only when shown for the first time.
    if(firstActivation) {
        // Create a container that has a scroll bar
        UnityEngine::GameObject* container = BSML::Lite::CreateScrollableSettingsContainer(self->get_transform());

        // Create a text that says "Hello World!" and set the parent to the container.
        BSML::Lite::CreateText(container->get_transform(), "Hello World!");
    }
}
```

There are too many UI components and methods to document in this guide. However, the files in the `BSML-Lite/Creation`
folder have comments that document almost all the methods.

## Registering `DidActivate`

`bsml` contains a few locations you can register to:

- Main Menu Mod Tabs
  ![Main Menu Mod Tabs](/.assets/images/modding/quest-menu-mod-tab.png)
- Mod Settings
  ![Mod Settings](/.assets/images/modding/quest-mod-settings.jpg)
- Gameplay Setup
  ![Gameplay Setup](/.assets/images/modding/quest-gameplay-settings.jpg)

For `bsml` to use your `DidActivate` method, you will need to register it using the `BSML::Register` class in your
`late_load()` method.

```cpp
#include "bsml/shared/BSML.hpp"

// other code

extern "C" void late_load() {
    // make sure this is after il2cpp_functions::Init()
    BSML::Init();
    BSML::Register::RegisterMainMenuViewControllerMethod(title, text, hoverHint, DidActivate);

    // other code
}
```

The gameplay setup location requires a slightly different function signature than the other two, with the arguments
being just `UnityEngine::GameObject* self, bool firstActivation`.

All the register functions can be found in the `BSML.hpp` file.
