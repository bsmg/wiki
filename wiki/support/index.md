## 0. Updates

After an update, the BSMG discord [#modding-announcements](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/612468002243477505)
channel should have the most up to date information
on the status of mods. The following are more detailed instructions of the most common procedure.

### Update broke my mods

**Run the game once** on the new update. Then, reinstall your mods using an installer
linked in the [beginner's guide](/beginners-guide), such as BSManager.

## 1. No mods?

### Misc Questions

#### 1.1 No mods appear on a fresh copy of the game

First, make sure that the following are correct:

- **You ran the game once before installing mods**. BSIPA removes all mods on the first run of a fresh update to prevent
  broken old mods from loading on a new version. If you installed mods before running your game after
  an update, install mods again.
- Steam/Oculus is launching Beat Saber from the **same installation** that mods are in. _e.g. mods are on the D drive but
  steam is launching from the C drive._ Set the correct install location in your choice of installer.
- If you installed mods manually, make sure you included all the files from the download and put them in the correct
  folders, as well as their dependencies.

#### 1.2 I had mods installed on an older version, but nothing loads after an update

If the details in section 1.1 above are correct, try the solutions below, in descending order.

##### Solution 1 (Steam Only)

- [Verify your game files](#verify-game-files)
- Update your mods in your mod installer by pressing `Install or Update`

##### Solution 2

:::tip NOTE
This only works if you downgraded to `1.29.1` using the beta branch methods!
:::

- Go into your Beat Saber folder
- Delete the `IPA\Backups` folder
- Uninstall BSIPA
- Reinstall and follow the regular modding process

##### Solution 3

- Go into your Beat Saber folder
- Run `IPA.exe`

:::tip NOTE
Be sure to close your game before running this executable!
If you see red text in the command prompt that appears when running the executable, then screenshot it and ask the
[BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) for help.
:::

##### Solution 4

If you are using Mod Assistant and are modding versions `1.37.2` and above, try the following:

- Uninstall all mods by going to the `Options` tab, and then selecting `Remove All Mods`
- Switch to a different mod installer, such as [BSManager](https://bsmanager.io), as Mod Assistant
  cannot reliably mod versions `1.37.2` and above.

##### Solution 5

:::tip NOTE
You only need to try this once!
:::

- Click `Install or Update` again in your mod installer

##### Solution 6

- If all else fails, perform a [Clean Installation](#clean-installation)

#### 1.2 Mod Assistant doesn't seem to be installing any mods

The installers download mods to `Beat Saber/IPA/Pending`, BSIPA moves these files to root folder when you launch the game.
If your game Plugins folder still is empty afterwards, run `IPA.exe` again and make sure that nothing is preventing it
from running, e.g. `Anti-viruses, Admin permissions, etc.`

:::warning NOTE
Mod Assistant has issues reliably modding versions `1.37.2` and above.

If you are on one of these versions, consider uninstalling all mods and switching to another mod manager
such as [BSManager](https://bsmanager.io) instead.
:::

## 2. Game Issues Post-Modding

### Game Won't Start

#### 2.1 Black Screen

If the game is just an infinite black screen when launching the game, this may be the cause of various things.
Here is a list of various common things that can cause this:

- Too New/Outdated Mods
  - If you're using a mod installer, try removing all of your mods, and reinstalling them again.
- Needing to Verify Game Files
  - Refer to this: [Verifying Files](#verify-game-files)
- Unity Crash
  - If a popup appears on startup on your computer, then refer to [Unity Crash](#23-unity-crash)

If none of the methods work here, seek out help in the [BSMG Discord.](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)

#### 2.2 GetThreadContext Failed Error

If a window pops up saying `GetThreadContext Failed` and/or you hear a Windows error sound, you may have software on your
PC that breaks Beat Saber mods. Many third-party anti-cheat software like ESEA and FaceIt disrupt BSIPA from applying mods
to Beat Saber, even when not running. Some Anti-Virus software also exhibit similar behavior.

To solve this problem:

1. Uninstall the anti-cheat software.
2. Reboot your PC.
3. Check if any remnants of the software still exist in your `AppData` folders.
4. Run the game.
   If problems persist then try the following:

   Steam: [Verify Game Files](#verify-game-files)
   Oculus: Perform a [Clean Installation](#clean-installation)

   :::tip NOTE
   The problem can continue to persist due to lacking permissions or exceptions, or programs marked suspicious
   can make this problem persist.
   :::

This should fix the problem.

#### 2.3 Frozen on Startup

If the game is frozen at the Health and Safety screen, or you see an avatar T-posing with no control of the game,
[verify your files](#verify-game-files) if you have the game on Steam, or reinstall the game from the
Oculus Software if you are on the Oculus PC version of the game. Refer to [Clean Installation](#clean-installation)

This seems to happen when updating Beat Saber and having mods installed previously,
but not to users with clean installs of the game.

#### 2.4 Unity Crash

If the game auto-closes/black screens on startup with the popup below, then try these steps one at a time:

![Unity Crash Popup](/.assets/images/support/UnityCrashPopup.png)

##### Fixes for Game Version 1.29.1 and Below

- Press WIN+R on your keyboard, and paste in the following command: `reg delete "HKCU\Software\Hyperbolic Magnetism"`
  and press enter.
  - This will bring up a confirmation prompt. Before selecting Yes, be sure that it says it is
    deleting `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Hyperbolic Magnetism`!
- If you have multiple monitors, you can try these fixes:
  - Set the game to play on your main monitor by changing your primary display in Windows to your 1st monitor.
  - Change your UI scaling of your 2nd monitor to the same as your main monitor.
  - Disconnect your other monitors altogether.

##### Fix for Game Versions between 1.29.4 and 1.37.1

- Having some specific sabers in your `CustomSabers` folder can crash your game (mostly iSF Sabers), check with
  the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) for a list of known sabers that can cause this.
  - To determine the culprit, try removing all sabers from your `CustomSabers` folder and adding them back in one by one.

##### Fixes for Any Version

- Try verifying the game's file integrity by following the steps here: [Verifying Files](#verify-game-files)
- Try restarting your PC.
  :::tip NOTE
  Shutting down and powering back on is not the same as using the restart button!
  :::
- Make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date.

If none of the steps worked here, seek out help in the [BSMG Discord.](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)

### Framerate Issues

#### 2.5 The game stutters unbearably after installing mods

If the game lags so badly that you can barely click the `Continue` button on the Health & Safety screen, then [verify files](#verify-game-files)
if you have the game on Steam, or reinstall the game on Oculus Home. Do the same if it won't start up at all and shows
no error messages when trying to launch the game.

If that didn't solve the issue, then check section [2.5 Improving framerate](#_2-5-improving-framerate)

#### 2.6 Improving Framerate

If [2.5](#2-5-the-game-stutters-unbearably-after-installing-mods) didn't improve your fps, then your PC might
simply be struggling to keep up with the stress caused by mods. Here are some things you can do to improve
framerate, in no particular order:

- Check to see if NVIDIA GEFORCE EXPERIENCE set the rendering scale for Beat Saber past the default of 1.0.
  It may have set it to a higher number to 1.4 or 1.8 which significantly increases the GPU load.
- Use a less complex custom avatar.
- The custom saber **Plasma Katanas** have tons of custom events and are known to introduce lag if you miss.
- Turn down Render Scale, Anti-Aliasing, mirror, fog, etc in the base game settings.
- Disable Anti-Aliasing completely by going to the game's graphics settings and setting `Anti-Aliasing` to 0x.
- For Oculus Rift (CV1) players: consider using 2 sensors instead of 3+.
- Reduce your total mod count.
- Low framerate can also be caused by something going wrong within your application data folder,
  refer to [Deleting the Beat Saber AppData Folder](#deleting-your-save-in-appdata)
- Disable Counters+ counters like score counter and swing speed as they can be expensive.
- HTTPStatus and DataPuller can cause lag spikes. Test without this mod to see if the lag spikes go away.
- Perform a [Clean Installation](#clean-installation) of the game files.

VR is very CPU intensive, especially if you add mods. If you're struggling to run the game with the mods you want, consider
upgrading your hardware. Note that Beat Saber doesn't utilize the GPU very much as visually it's a fairly simple game.

To check if your PC meets the recommended specs, go
to the [Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/) and scroll down until you
see the `System Requirements` section, which tells you the recommended specs.

## 3. Common Questions

### Misc

#### 3.1 Blank Menu, No Buttons or Gray Environment

If your main window in game is blank or your menu looks gray and no buttons work, your mod installer
likely didn't patch the game files properly.
To fix this, try uninstalling and reinstalling BSIPA, and [verifying the game files.](#verify-game-files)

![Blank Menu Environment](/.assets/images/support/BlankMenuEnvironment.png)

![Gray Menu Environment](/.assets/images/support/GrayMenuEnvironment.png)

#### 3.2 How do I use `x` mod?

If you're using a mod installer, click the mod and hit the "Mod Info/More info" button.
[BeatMods](http://beatmods.com) has a "More Info" button on each mod as well.

#### 3.3 Rumble Issues

If you use a Rift S or Quest 1, then you will not have any haptics if you are using Oculus as your current OpenXR
runtime. This is due to an update to the Oculus Software that has not been fixed yet.

In the meantime, you can try the following:

- Switch to the SteamVR OpenXR Runtime
- Apply the fix listed below _(not recommended)_

If switching to SteamVR as the current OpenXR runtime didn't work, then you can try the following:

_Keep in mind that there can be unknown side effects when using this fix!_

- Close all instances of Oculus in Task Manager, and then download [this zip file,](https://tinyurl.com/Ocufix)
  which has the DLL files in order to fix this.
- Open the zip file and copy the DLLs inside it to this folder: `%OculusBase%Support\oculus-runtime`

  :::tip NOTE
  Copy and paste the filepath into the address bar at the top of File Explorer!

  Before moving the files, be sure to make a backup of the existing files first!
  :::

- Reopen Oculus, and your game should work after this!

If this isn't the cause of your rumble issues and the following are true regarding your haptics:

- haptics are miniscule
- there is no vibration when hitting multiple blocks
- there is a slight delay when touching sabers together
- you are using Oculus touch controllers

Then there is a good chance that Beat Saber is overloading your motherboard's USB controller. Oculus devours your USB controller
bandwidth and most motherboards come with a very cheap controller. Beat Saber pushes it harder than any other game, which
is why other games and menus might be fine. There is no clear-cut solution, so try the following:

- Shuffle the sensor and HMD USB cables around in different ports
- Unplug unnecessary USB devices
- Buy a PCI-E USB hub
- Use `-vrmode oculus` if you're using SteamVR to bypass it and use the Oculus SDK instead

:::tip NOTE
`-vrmode oculus` only works on `1.29.1` and below! If you are on any higher version, do this instead:

- Go to your Oculus Software
- Go to Settings > General
- Click the `Set Meta Quest Link as active OpenXR Runtime` button
  :::

### Custom Avatars

#### 3.4 Custom Avatars (Not) Showing Ingame

Click the **Home** button on your keyboard with the game in focus to toggle visibility in the headset.

#### 3.5 My Avatars Are Broken

Make sure your custom avatars mod is installed properly and updated, also make sure your dependencies are too.
You might have a corrupted/broken avatar, having one avatar break can break all of your avatars likewise with songs and sabers.

### Custom Songs

#### 3.6 My Songs Are Missing

Make sure your songs are in your `CustomLevels` folder, located at `Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/`.
This is where the game natively reads custom songs from.

:::warning DISCLAIMER
**Do not** place songs in the old `Beat Saber/CustomSongs` folder. This location is deprecated as the format for custom
songs has changed. If you have maps in the old format (`.json` and `.ogg` files instead of `.dat` and `.egg`),
leave them in the old `Beat Saber/CustomSongs` folder. You will need to download them again from BeatSaver.

Alternatively you can manually convert them using [Song Converter](https://github.com/luludotdev/songe-converter) however,
you will not get any help with this method and need to compile the program yourself.
:::

#### 3.7 Grayed Out Play Button

Click the shiny blue question mark (?) button in the top right corner. This should tell you what mods are required to
play the song, which you are missing and should install. If it is still not working, try re-installing the required mod.

#### 3.8 Map details are infinitely loading

If this only happens on particular maps, you may be missing required mods or those song files are broken.
If it happens to all of your maps, delete your `Plugins` folder and reinstall fresh ones.

### Camera2

#### 3.9 My desktop view only takes up a small section of the screen

Your Camera2 display isn't filling up your canvas. Either drag the corner to fit the screen,
or right click the window and click "Fit to Canvas".

### BeatSaver Downloader

#### 3.10 BeatSaver Downloader More Songs Button

**The More Songs button is located in the main menu to the left under the Mods text.** If the button for More Songs is
greyed out then make sure all your songs loaded first, as seen in by the rainbow progress bar on the main menu.
If your Mods menu isn't there then make sure your mods and dependencies are working and installed properly,
refer to the [No Mods?](#_1-no-mods) section.

#### 3.11 Nothing Showing Up In The More Songs Menu

The probable causes for BeatSaver Downloader not working are:

1. Make sure all of your songs have loaded in before, or else the More Songs button will be greyed out.
2. Your anti-virus or firewall blocking access to BeatSaver.
3. You have hit Beatsaver's rate limit and will have to wait before trying again.

| CFR-10     | Your session key from Steam or Oculus is not valid. If you are playing on Quest and have modded your game, check out this [FAQ answer](/faq/#does-multiplayer-have-crossplay) to work around this.

## 4. Miscellaneous Troubleshooting

### Understanding Logs

If you're on Steam you can go to

> Beat Saber > Properties > General > Add `--verbose` to the launch options field

If you're on Oculus then you will have to Right click on Beat Saber.exe and create a shortcut.
Edit the Target to add "--verbose" to the end of it.
e.g. `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\Beat Saber.exe" --verbose`

After adding verbose to your game hopefully it will display any errors regarding your avatars, sabers, and songs

- This may not show 100% of the time for avatars and sabers, and you may have to remove all your avatars/sabers and try
  them one by one to see which one breaks the game.

These messages are also written to `Beat Saber/Logs`.

A list of common exceptions can be found [here](./exceptions.md).

### Verify Game Files

To verify the integrity of the game files follow these steps:

If you use Steam:

1. Make sure SteamVR is closed, as it won't let you verify your games otherwise.
2. Go to your Steam library and find Beat Saber
3. Right click Beat Saber and click on Properties
4. Go to the "Installed Files" tab in Properties
5. Select the "Verify Integrity Of Game Files" option.
6. Let it finish verifying and downloading any missing files
   and you should be good to go.

If you use BSManager:

1. Select the version in which you want to verify your files
2. Click on the gear icon in the top right corner, and select `Verify files`
3. Let it finish verifying and downloading any missing files
   and you should be good to go.

If you use Oculus and are not using BSManager, then you can:

- Download BSManager and verify your files from there.

Here is a [Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBFfT4-ZiIc) although it is on the old steam UI,
the steps are still the same.

### Clean Installation

:::tip PC Oculus Users
Uninstalling and reinstalling the game from the Oculus Software effectively clean reinstalls the game,
so no need to follow this.

Note that this will not delete your Beat Saber AppData folder. To delete that, follow this guide:
[Deleting the Beat Saber AppData Folder](#deleting-your-save-in-appdata).
:::

1. (Optional) Back up your downloaded custom content by making a copy of the following folders:

- `Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels`
- `Beat Saber\CustomSabers`
- `Beat Saber\CustomPlatforms`
- `Beat Saber\CustomNotes`
- `Beat Saber\CustomAvatars`

2. **Delete the ENTIRE Beat Saber Folder.** This is different from uninstalling the game on steam,
   as those methods will not remove files that did not come with the game.

> Steam: `\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\`
> Oculus: `\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\`

3. Reinstall the game via the Steam or Oculus store
4. **Before modding, launch the game once**
5. Run your mod installer, install your mods, and boot up the game.

(Optional) If you want to take it one step further, refer to: [Deleting the Beat Saber AppData Folder](#deleting-your-save-in-appdata).

### Deleting Your Save in AppData

This will delete your scores and local data, but not your custom leaderboard/ScoreSaber stats. You can find the folder at

> `%appdata%/../locallow/hyperbolic magnetism/beat saber`

Copy and paste everything from inside the bar above and paste it to your address bar in file explorer and delete it.

You can also get to this folder by showing hidden items and navigating to your

> Users > "USER" > AppData > LocalLow > Hyperbolic Magnetism > beat saber

<YouTube url='https://youtu.be/ONxJcD3Ir3Q' />

::: warning
Deleting this folder in AppData will also delete your local scores, statistics, and songs you've favorited.

#### Desperate Measures

::: warning
Disabling your anti-virus involves security risks, be sure to know what you're doing
(i.e don't download or open suspicious files while it's turned off)
and don't forget to re-enable it as soon as you finished these steps.
:::

- Make sure your current user **is an administrator**
- Turn your anti-virus **Off** (for the meantime at least)
- Ensure that you have permission to create folders and edit files within the disk drive/your pc,
  (from what I heard a windows update recently caused problems for people)
- Ensure that your drivers are up to date
- Check that the problem doesn't lie within your headset, or operating system, or your hardware/software
- Check your internet connection, and that nothing is blocking anything related to beatsaber modding and steam etc.

## 5. Still Having Issues

If this page doesn't cover the bases, then feel free to ask a question in the [Discord!](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)

To increase the chance that you'll have your questions answered, consider the following:

- Use the correct channels please, `#pc-help` for pc mod support and `#quest-help` for quest mod support. Use `#pc-3d-modeling`
  and `#quest-3d-modeling` for questions about **making your own avatars, platforms, notes, or sabers**, and `#mapping-discussion`
  for questions about **making maps.**
- Be polite and respectful
- Describe your problem in detail. "It didn't work" is about as descriptive as telling your doctor you don't feel well.
  What's not working, and what did you try? Are there any messages that come up on screen?
  Did your entire screen turn bright purple?

::: tip NOTE
Those with the `Support` and/or `Mapping Support` role are volunteers that might choose to help out in their free time.
The support roles are in recognition of the knowledge and effort they have put forth, but it doesn't
necessarily mean that they'll be around to help just because they're online.
