# 3D Awtysts

From sabers to notes, custom models have always been a popular aspect of modded beat saber which wouldn't be possible without them.

That is professor to you! Updated the Custom platforms guide and created the materials guide. I consider myself a 3d artist. Ive made sabers, custom platforms, vrc avatars and so much more. Also the creator of the [Crystallized platform](https://www.patreon.com/games_plats). I embrace creativity so much I sometimes forget to take breaks while working! If you need help with anything modeling related I'm usually active in [#pc-3d-modeling](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/468249466865057802) in BSMG.

Most well known for their incredibly flashy dance platform and space opera sabers, but it's a little known fact that they also make mods!

"The guy who made giant glowing dicks in beat saber" ~Emulamer 12th of July 2019

As you can read I make sabers for quest, but generally I've been active in the asset modding part of beat saber, I've also done some for other games but Beat saber is my main love. If you ever need help making sabers specifically for quest you can always ask me over in the quest modeling channel (until we get that qsaber mod anyways) keep on sabering that meat till it's real tender!
