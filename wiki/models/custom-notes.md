# Custom Notes

## Installation

:::tip NOTE
Notes need to be made specifically for Quest or PC and are not interchangeable between the two. You can tell which platform
a note is for by the file extension. `.bloq` files are for PC while Quest uses `.zip` files.
:::

### PC Notes

The latest Custom Notes mod can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord
or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant).

Once installed, you should see a `CustomNotes` folder in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md), with some sample
notes installed for you. This folder is also where you will place `*.bloq` files.

You can download more bloqs from [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Bloqs/).

### Quest Notes

Custom Notes for Quest are provided by the Qosmetics mod. The latest version can be found in the
[#quest-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG discord. Notes are called `qbloqs` and are currently
hosted in the [Qosmetics Community Discord](https://discord.gg/qosmetics).

## Usage

### PC Users

Inside the game in the main menu you will see on the left a `CUSTOM NOTES` button under the `Mods` section. Pressing it
will open up the menu you can use to select which notes you want to use.

### Quest Users

Upload the `.qbloq` file to your Quest using the [BMBF Web Interface](/quest-modding.md#installing-mods). You can then
select which note is active from the Qosmetics menu in-game.

## Creating Custom Notes

[Bobbie's Bloq Guide](./notes-guide.md) is a good resource for creating custom notes from an existing model.

Note that this guide does not cover 3D modeling the notes. For that, we recommend looking up some tutorials on [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)!
