# Custom Avatars
## Installation
The latest Custom Avatar plugin can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG discord or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant).
Once installed you should see a file called `CustomAvatar.dll` inside your `Plugins` folder. You should also see a folder called `CustomAvatars` in the main install folder—this is where you will be placing the `*.avatar` files you want to use. You can download more avatars on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Avatars/).

## Usage

The plugin uses the keyboard to change the settings. Make sure you have the game in focus, i.e. click on the desktop game window.

Some avatars were not made with first person view in mind, so they might block your vision if enabled.

## Creating Avatars
[Assistant's Avatar Guide](https://bs.assistant.moe/Avatars) is a good resource for learning how to make your own avatar.

The guide includes a [short video narrated by Megalon](https://bs.assistant.moe/Avatars#Videos), however it is intended to be an overview and you should watch it in addition to reading the guide, not lieu of.
