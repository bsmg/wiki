# Shader Migration Guide

_Bobbie's Guide to migrating shaders on Beat Saber models._

## Intro

When Beat Saber updated to 1.29.4, the developers changed the render type from `Single Pass` to `Single Pass Instanced`.
Unfortunately, the Beat Saber model projects were not set up to handle this change gracefully,
so all models created up until this point have invalid shaders.

These invalid shaders only show up in the left eye and completely ruin a model when wearing a VR headset.

Fortunately, there is a library and `.unitypackage` that can help you
make this transition easily, even with large model projects.

## AssetBundleLoadingTools

[AssetBundleLoadingTools](https://github.com/legoandmars/AssetBundleLoadingTools) is a library that
aims to fix broken legacy models using pre-converted `.shaderbundle` files.

A `.shaderbundle` is a file that contains shaders that have been recompiled to comply with the Single Pass Instanced changes.

Unfortunately, this library of pre-converted shaders only includes common shaders like `BeatSaber/Unlit` and `BS_Uber`.
If you've ever made a custom shader or downloaded one from a niche source, there's an extremely high chance it's _not_ included.

You can fix this in one of two following ways:

- [Exporting your own .shaderbundles to fix all of your old models at once (recommended)](#exporting-custom-shaderbundles)
- [Converting your shaders to work with Single Pass Instancing, then re-exporting your models](#converting-project-shaders)

## Setting Up ShaderBundleExporter

The ShaderBundleExporter `.unitypackage` is what you'll need to fix your shaders, [and can be downloaded here](https://bsmg.dev/V984m)

### Before Installation

Your model project's Unity Version is very important.
If you're on `Unity 2018.1.9f` or lower, you **NEED** to upgrade your project to a higher unity version.

The minimum supported Unity Version is `Unity 2018.2.0f`,
but it's recommended you upgrade to at least `Unity 2019.3.15f` to enable every ShaderExporter feature.

You can find a list of Unity Versions on the [Unity Download Archive](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive)
page. Make sure to backup your project before upgrading!

::: warning
If you're upgrading an older Unity project, an extremely common to see an error like  
`Assembly 'Assets/Runtime/CustomNotes.dll' will not be loaded due to errors:`

This error is very easy to fix - just go to the .dll in your project,
uncheck `Validate References` in the inspector, and click `Apply`
:::

### Installation Instructions

Simply drag `ShaderBundleExporter.unitypackage into your project` and click `Import`.

The `.unitypackage` is mostly self contained, and should not interfere with anything else.

Restart your project and you're finished with the installation!

### Other Info

The ShaderBundleExporter adds some helpful shader warnings when exporting a model.

If you export a model that contains unconverted shaders, a warning will pop up in the console:

![Model Export Warnings](/.assets/images/models/shaders/ModelExportWarnings.png)

It's important to pay attention to these, as these shaders have a high chance of only appearing in one eye ingame.
For more about converting shaders, see the [converting project shaders](#converting-project-shaders) section.

## Converting Project Shaders

If you'd like to continue creating new models after the 1.29.4 update,
all of your shaders will need to be updated to support Single Pass Instanced.

::: warning
If you have many public models released, it is **NOT** advised to manually re-export all of your models,
as it will take far too much time and effort

You can easily do this by [creating a custom .shaderbundle](#exporting-custom-shaderbundles) -
check that section out first if this applies to you
:::

The ShaderBundleExporter contains some useful utilities to automate shader conversion:

![shader convert window](/.assets/images/models/shaders/ShaderWindow.png)

- Convert All Shaders In Project
- Convert All Shaders In Folder
- Convert Shader By File
- Convert All Shaders In Selected GameObject(s)

It's recommended that you `Convert All Shaders In Project` to convert everything out at once.

If you don't have much time or don't feel like potentially manually fixing up a bunch of shaders,
you can always select a model and do `Convert All Shaders In Selected GameObject(s)` to just fix up that specific model.

You can also convert a specific shader by using `Convert Shader By File`.

::: warning
These actions will overwrite the .shader files found within your Unity project.
It _will_ create .shaderbackup files, but it's always recommended to
backup your full project before making any big changes.
:::

### After Conversion

After converting your shaders, the `Console` tab will contain useful information that tells you
how much of your shader library was automatically converted.

![shader convert export](/.assets/images/models/shaders/ShaderConvertExport.png)

As you can see, some of these shaders couldn't be autoconverted.
Most shaders - especially shaders included by default in model Unity Projects - are fairly simple,
and the Shader Converter will be able to convert them without issue.

However, there's a _lot_ of different types of shaders, and the autoconverter is only so smart.
Check out the [Manual Shader Conversion](#manually-converting-shaders) instructions for
more info on how to fix shaders that couldn't be automatically converted.

Once you've finished converting all your shaders, you can re-export models AND export new models without worrying.
Converted shaders will function properly on both old and new Beat Saber versions!

::: warning
You should double check that your shaders look fine in-VR before publishing models with them!
If the autoconversion messed up a specific shader, you can always open the `.shaderbackup`,
copy the source code into the `.shader`, and [Manually Convert](#manually-converting-shaders) it.
:::

## Exporting Custom .shaderbundles

This is the **RECOMMENDED WAY** to fix your shaders if you've released a lot of models.
If you're just trying to fix one specific model or export new models,
check out the [Converting Project Shaders](#converting-project-shaders) section.

`.shaderbundle`s work using the same system as automatic shader conversion.
If you've already converted your shaders to Single Pass Instanced, the `.shaderbundle` will use those -
otherwise it will try to autoconvert them without saving the changes permanently.

The exported files are also identical to any other model file. All of your shaders are _compiled_ into a bundle,
and the source code isn't in the final product - exactly like a saber, platform, avatar, etc.

The `Shaders/Create .shaderbundle` window contains three ways to build a `.shaderbundle`
![Shader Bundle Window](/.assets/images/models/shaders/ShaderBundlesWindow.png)

- All Shaders In Project: The recommended way to export shaders. If you export this, you will have
  one .shaderbundle file that can fix the vast majority of your models!
- All Shaders In Folder: Situationally useful. Good if you have a specific subfolder you want to export from.
- All Shaders For Selected GameObject(s): Can be useful for exporting shaders for multiple models at once.

After selecting one of these options, the `.shaderbundle` compiler will do the following:

- Get all the shaders for the relevant export type
- Use the [Automatic Shader Converter](#converting-project-shaders) to "inject"
  Single Pass Instanced keywords into as many shaders as possible
- Export a `.shaderbundle` file at the provided path

### After Export

Once you've exported a .shaderbundle, the `Console` tab will contain useful information to see how your bundle export went.

There's a list of every shader that was successfully exported and some helpful stats:
![.shaderbundle export info](/.assets/images/models/shaders/ShaderExportInfo.png)

If any of your shaders are unusual and unable to be autoconverted, they'll show errors in the console:
![.shaderbundle export errors](/.assets/images/models/shaders/ShaderExportErrors.png)

These errors are pretty verbose, and upon click will show more information on what exactly went wrong during the autoconversion.
Read the [Manual Shader Conversion](#manually-converting-shaders) instructions to learn how to fix these.

### .shaderbundle Installation

Make sure you have `AssetBundleLoadingTools` installed so you can load your built `.shaderbundle`.

Go to your Beat Saber's game folder, then navigate to `UserData` -> `AssetBundleLoadingTools` -> `ShaderBundles`

Copy and paste your `.shaderbundle` into that folder so the shaderbundle libarary recognizes it.

### Distributing Your .shaderbundle

You can send the `.shaderbundle` to whoever you want, and it should work fine as long as they follow the above instructions.

However, this is _clearly_ not ideal if you create public models. If somebody's downloaded
your old models and they don't have the bundle, they'll still be broken!

This is where the **extremely important** `.shaderbundle` autoupdater comes in. `AssetBundleLoadingTools` automatically
downloads `.shaderbundle` files from a web service, and you can easily add your own bundles to this service.

To add your bundles to the autoupdater, do one of the following:

- Contact Bobbie#0001 on discord
- Ask about it in the `#pc-3d-modeling` channel in the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)
- Open a Pull Request on [the repository](https://github.com/legoandmars/AssetBundleLoadingTools)
  if you know what you're doing

Once your `.shaderbundle` is added to the web service, everybody on new versions of Beat Saber
will receive fixed versions of your shaders, making their experience smooth and
not requiring them to hunt down updated copies of your models.

## Manually Converting Shaders

Sometimes the autoconverter will fail to make a shader support Single Pass Instanced.
This can happen for many reasons, and a specific reason is usually printed as an error message.
When this happens, you'll need to manually convert following these steps:

### Check If It Already Works

First, test if the shader already works! Some shaders are already converted to work
with Single Pass Instanced, but the autoconverter can't detect it properly.
This generally happens with complex shaders that use a lot of `.cginc` files, like `BS Uber` and `Poyomi`

If you're exporting a `.shaderbundle`:

- Go to the settings in `Editor/AssetBundleLoadingTools/ShaderBundleSettings` and enable
  `Export Broken Shaders`. **MAKE SURE TO TURN THIS OFF & RE-EXPORT BEFORE SHARING YOUR SHADERBUNDLE!**
- Load a legacy model that uses the same shader and see if it's only rendering in one eye

If you're converting your project's shaders:

- Export a model that uses the shader that failed to convert
- Load the model ingame and see if it's only rendering in one eye

If you've completed this step and it's already rendering properly, congratulations, you don't need to do any conversion!

Navigate to `Editor/AssetBundleLoadingTools/ShaderBundleSettings` and either drag the shader onto
`Already Converted Shaders` or add the shader's name in `Already Converted Shader Names`

### Add Single Pass Instanced Keywords

If your shader still doesn't work, you'll need to manually add the necessary keywords to support Single Pass Instancing.

Detailed instructions can be found on [this official Unity Guide](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SinglePassInstancing.html)

After completing the official Unity instructions, follow the steps in [Check If It Already Works](#check-if-it-already-works)
to make sure your shader works and if so, add it to your `Already Converted Shaders`

### Manual Conversion Isn't Working

Shaders can be fairly complex and these rules don't always apply.

If you're not familiar with shaders, have questions about the general shader conversion process,
or need help converting a specific shader, please ask in the `#pc-3d-modeling` channel in the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods)
