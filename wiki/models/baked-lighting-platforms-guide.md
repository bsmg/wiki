# Baked Lighting Platforms Guide
You can now have Unity's Baked Lighting inside your Custom Platform!

[日本語版はこちらへ](../ja/models/baked-lighting-platforms-guide.md)

## First Steps
The version of Unity for making Custom Platforms is [2019.3.15f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive#download-archive-2019).
First create a platform the normal way as per the [Guide to making Custom Platforms](platforms-guide.md).

**Please use BeatSaber compatible shaders that work with Baked Lighting.  You can use the Custom.shader and
GlassRefraction.shader shaders from the Beat Saber Modding Group's [BS_Shader_Pack (Discord Link)](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/468249466865057802/732620241502339093).**

When you are finished the top Platform GameObject will have a CustomPlatform script already attached to it.

## Unity's Baked Lighting

This part of the guide will go over how to bake lights in Unity 2019.3 and you can skip to [PrefabLightmapping](#prefablightmapping)
if you already know this.  

For more information, consult the [Unity Documentation on Baked Lighting](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/LightMode-Baked.html).

### Set Lights to Baked

You can have many lights in the scene and they can all cast shadows without affecting performance. All four type of lights
in Unity can be baked:

* Directional
* Point
* Spot
* Area

![Example of each light type](~@images/models/baked/01.png)

Set the **Mode** to **Baked** for the lights you want to be baked in the Inspector.  **Area Lights** do not need to be set
as they can only be used with Baked Lighting.

For the lights you want to cast shadows set the **Shadow Type** to **Soft Shadows**.

![Light Settings](~@images/models/baked/02.png)

For the **GameObjects** that cast and receive shadows in the Inspector in the **Mesh Render** section you must set these
options.

* **Cast Shadows** **On**
* **Receive Shadows** **Check**
* **Contribute Global Illumination** **Check**
* **Receive Global Illumination** **Lightmaps**

![Mesh Render Configuration](~@images/models/baked/03.png)

### Add UV Coordinates to All Objects

For all the prefabs of objects in your scene to be baked, you must have
[**Lightmap UVs**](https://docs.unity3d.com/2019.3/Documentation/Manual/LightingGiUvs-GeneratingLightmappingUVs.html).  

To let Unity automatically generate them for you click on each **Prefab** and in the Inspector under the Model tab,
click **Generate Lightmap UVs** and click **Apply**.　You can click on multiple prefabs to apply this all together.

![Lightmap UV Configuration](~@images/models/baked/04.png)

### Set All GameObjects and Lights to Static

Only **GameObjects** and **Lights** that are set to static will be used for Baked Lighting. Click on the GameObjects in
the scene in the Hierarchy list.

![Select GameObject](~@images/models/baked/05.png)

Then go to the Inspector and check Static.

![Set Static](~@images/models/baked/06.png)

If you change a top level GameObject to static, the Unity Editor will ask if you also want to also set all the children
to static, so you can easily change all objects in your scene.

### Use a Baked Lighting Compatible BeatSaber Shader

Not all Beat Saber compatible shaders work with Baked Lighting.  So far I've found that only the following shaders from
BSMG's [BS_Shader_Pack (Discord Link)](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/468249466865057802/732620241502339093)
will work:

* Custom.shader
* GlassRefraction.shader

You may be able to find other shaders that work with both Beat Saber's alpha glow problem and Baked Lighting but these
two will work for the majority of uses.

Import or Drop the shaders into your Unity Project. Then click on one or all of your materials and choose the Custom or
BeatSaber/GlassRefraction shader.

![Set Shader to Custom](~@images/models/baked/08.png)

Most details should be copied over but you may have to fix the settings again.

### Bake the Lights

Finally when steps 1 to 4 are done, in the menu choose Window -> Rendering -> Lighting Settings to open the Lighting Panel.

Note that Custom Platforms in Beat Saber cannot export and use the Skybox.  However the environment lightings and
reflections will influence your baking so set them to the right color or maps.  

* Set the Skybox Material to None
* Set Environment Lighting source to color
* Set Environment Reflections to Custom

![Object Configuration](~@images/models/baked/09.png)

You can use **Progressive GPU (Preview)** to do light baking if you have at least one GPU with 4GB VRAM and OpenCL 1.2
support.  

You can leave most options as default but I like to increase the **Lightmap Size** to 2048 and turn off **Auto Generate**
to stop it from constantly baking after every change.

Press **Generate Lighting** to create the light maps.

![Configure Renderer](~@images/models/baked/10.jpg)

**Progressive GPU (Preview)** however, sometimes crashes.  So you can also **Enlighten** which uses your CPU but is much
slower depending on your scene.  Both will make the appropriate light maps.

![Alternative Renderer](~@images/models/baked/11.png)

If the bake is successful, in the folder where your scene is there will be a folder of the same name.  The lightmap data
files will be there.

* LightingData
* Lightmap-0_comp_dir
* Lightmap-0_comp_light

![Lightmap Data Results](~@images/models/baked/12.png)

## Prefab Lightmapping

These following steps are for saving the baked lighting maps into a **Prefab** in the Custom Platform to be used inside
Beat Saber. Lightmapping data is normally exported per **Scene** (like in VRChat).  But a Custom Platform can only export
**Assets** in an **AssetBundle** so we have to attach all of the data to a **Prefab**.

In the **GameObject** with the Custom Platform script, add a new **Prefab Lightmap Data** component.

![Add new Prefab Lightmap Data](~@images/models/baked/13.png)

Then go to the menu and choose **Assets** -> **Bake Prefab Lightmaps**.  Once this is done the entries in the
**Prefab Lightmap Data** component will be filled.

![Import Result](~@images/models/baked/14.png)

Now you can **Export** the Custom Platform.

## Testing Your Platform in Beat Saber

Baked lighting requires [Custom Platforms version 6.1.17](https://github.com/affederaffe/CustomPlatforms/releases/tag/v6.1.17)
or later.

You will also need [Tweaks55](https://github.com/kinsi55/BeatSaber_Tweaks55/releases/tag/v0.3.8) to control the Beat Saber
menu lights which can interfere with Baked Lighting.

Install these MODs in your Beat Saber/Plugins folder first.  You can also install them through ModAssistant.

Copy the exported Custom Platform .plat file to your Beat Saber/CustomPlatforms folder and start Beat Saber.

### Use Tweak55 to Change the Menu Light

The Beat Saber menu light will reflect off of baked lighting while in the menu. Go to the **Tweak55 MOD**, the **UI tab**
and change **Menu Light Color**. You can set the Beat Saber menu light to black to turn it off or set it to a certain color.

![Tweak55 Color Change Demo](~@images/models/baked/16.jpg)

### Change the Colored Lights in Game

The colored lights during gameplay will also reflect off the baked lighting.  During song selection in the **Vanilla Tab**
in the left menu, choose **Colors**, **Override Default Colors** and click the **Edit Button** beside the row of colors.
You can set them to black to turn them off or set the colors to enhance the platform lighting.

![In Game Color Change Demo](~@images/models/baked/17.jpg)

### Other MODs Can Add Lights Which Affect the Platform

Other MODs can add extra lights into the scene.  If they don't have a Culling Mask set to limit Layer 1 they can interfere
with baked lighting.  

Pictured here is VMCAvatar.  If you are using this MOD you can use my [VMCLightDisabler](https://github.com/Kylon99/VMCLightDisabler/releases/tag/0.1.0)
to turn off the light whenever the scene changes.

## Play Beat Saber

Have fun with your new platform!
