# Custom Sabers
## Installation
:::tip NOTE
Sabers need to be made specifically for Quest or PC and are not interchangeable between the two. You can tell which platform a saber is for by the file extension. `.saber` files are for PC while Quest uses `.zip` files. 
:::

### PC Sabers
The latest Custom Saber plugin can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG discord or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant). Run ModAssistant, select the Custom Saber plugin, and click Install. Once you've installed it you will see a folder called `CustomSabers` in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md), this is where you should place the `*.saber` files you want to use. 

You can download more sabers on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Sabers/).

For those who want more customization to their sabers, [Saber Factory](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/SaberFactory#readme) allows you to create your own sabers in-game. You download parts and combine them like lego pieces with the ability to change the shape, shaders, material properties, textures and more.

### Quest Sabers 
Custom Sabers for Quest are provided by the Qosmetics mod. The latest version can be found in the [#quest-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG discord. Sabers are called `qsabers` and are currently hosted in the [Qosmetics Community Discord](https://discord.gg/qosmetics). 

## Usage

### PC Users
Inside the game in the main menu you will see on the left a `CUSTOM SABERS` or `SABERFACTORY` button under the `Mods` section. Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which sabers you want to use.
::: tip NOTE
Once selected, the sabers will only show up only while a song is playing and not while in the menu. 
:::

### Quest Users
Upload the saber zip file to your Quest using the [BMBF Web Interface](/quest-modding.md#installing-mods). You can then select which saber is active under the mods tab in BMBF.

## Creating Sabers
[MissRaynor's Saber Guide](/models/sabers-guide.md) is an excellent resource for learning how to make your own sabers.
