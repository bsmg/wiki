# Custom Sabers

## Installation

:::tip NOTE
Sabers need to be made specifically for Quest or PC and are not interchangeable between the two. You can tell which platform
a saber is for by the file extension. `.saber` files are for PC while Quest uses `.qsaber` or `.whacker` files.
:::

### PC Sabers

The latest mod for Custom Sabers is now called CustomSabersLite,
and can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord
or in your mod installer. Open your mod installer, select the CustomSabersLite mod, and click Install.

:::tip NOTE
CustomSabersLite is for 1.29.4 and above. If you are on 1.29.1, use the SaberFactory mod instead, found in your
mod installer.
:::

If it is not available in the above sources, you can check the
[GitHub Page](https://github.com/qqrz997/CustomSabersLite/releases) for the mod, or visit the
[SaberFactory Discord](https://discord.gg/PjD7WcChH3) for more information if you are using SaberFactory.
Once you have downloaded the mod, put the mod in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md) to install it.

Once the mod is installed you will see a folder called `CustomSabers`
in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md), this is where you should place the `*.saber` files you want to use.

You can download more sabers on [ModelSaber](https://modelsaber.com/Sabers/), [BSManager](https://bsmanager.io),
or the [#pc-models channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord.

### Quest Sabers

Custom Sabers for Quest are provided by the Qosmetics mod. The latest version can be found in the
[#quest-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord. Sabers are called `whackers` and are currently
hosted in the [Qosmetics Community Discord](https://discord.gg/qosmetics). Legacy filetypes like `.qsaber` made for older
versions can still be used. `.zip` files can also be used but will require you to extract **only** the `.qsaber`.

:::tip NOTE
`.whacker` files are supported on both PC and Quest using the CustomSabersLite mod on versions `1.36.2` and above!
Install them like you would a normal `.saber` file. Note that `.qsaber` files are not supported on PC.
:::

## Usage

### PC Users

Inside the game in the main menu you will see on the left a `CUSTOM SABERS` or `CUSTOMSABERSLITE` button under
the `Mods` section.
Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which sabers you want to use.

### Quest Users

Upload the `.whacker` or `.qsaber` file to your Quest using [ModsBeforeFriday](../quest/modding-with-mbf.md).
You can then select which saber is active from the Qosmetics menu in-game.

## Creating Sabers

[MissRaynor's Saber Guide](./sabers-guide.md) is an excellent resource for learning how to make your own sabers.
