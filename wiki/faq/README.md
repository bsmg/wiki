# Frequently Asked Questions

## I just got the game, how do I get started?
Check out our [beginner's guide](/beginners-guide.md)!

## How do I get more songs?
> [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com) is the master repository of custom songs made by the community.
> Many other tools and sites enhance the experience of downloading custom songs, but this place is where they are hosted.

If you download maps manually from BeatSaver, extract them into a folder and place the files in `Beat Saber/Beat Saber_Data/CustomLevels`.
This is the directory that the game natively reads custom maps from.

### BeastSaber
[Beast Saber](https://www.bsaber.com) is a review site that aims to curate all of the songs on BeatSaver.
You can also download playlists, follow mappers, find songs using advanced sorting methods and more.

### Song Management Tools

The following can be used to help you manage custom songs or playlists.

* [BeatList](https://github.com/ranmd9a/beatlist/releases/latest) is a desktop app to manage custom songs and playlists,
 maintained by **ranmd9a**.
* [BeaterList](https://syltaris.github.io/beaterlist) is a browser based service by **zexurge** to manage playlists.

## How do I install playlists?

### PC
You need to install the [PlaylistManager](https://github.com/rithik-b/PlaylistManager/releases/latest) mod.

Then you can either:

* Use the `Install Playlist` tool in the Options tab of Mod Assistant.
* Place the playlist file into `Beat Saber/Playlists`, select the playlist title header in-game, then hit download all songs.

You should see the playlist next to the Custom Levels album's in-game. The mod also supports managing playlists in-game.

### Quest
You can use [Playlist Editor Pro](https://beatsaberquest.com/bmbf/my-tools/playlist-editor-pro/) to manage the playlists
on your Quest. Note that a custom level can only appear once in-game due to a limitation with BMBF.

:::warning WARNING for Quest Users
Reloading your Custom Songs Folder resets all playlist organization.

## How do I make my own custom levels?
See [mapping](/mapping/)!

## How do I load PC mods that aren't in Mod Assistant?
See [this section](/pc-modding.md#manual-installation) in the beginners guide.

## Does multiplayer have crossplay?
Officially, multiplayer is limited to playing with other people in the store version (Oculus/Steam) you purchased.
Additionally, modifying the game on Quest disables official multiplayer.

The BeatTogether mod is the current solution for cross-platform play between the modded game versions. Join their
[Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/gezGrFG4tz) and check the `#install-instructions` channel for more information.

## My game updated and now none of my mods are working
Each time the game updates it is possible *(and very likely)* that your existing mods will stop working and need to be updated.
To make sure your install will not break when the game runs on a new update for the first time, everything
in the `Plugins` folder is automatically moved into a new folder called `Old 1.xx.x Plugins`. **Leave those plugins/mods
in there!**

To get mods back, simply **run the installer again.**  
The BeatMods repository only includes mods that have been confirmed to work on the latest version of the game!

If you're confused by any of this, visit [Beginners Guide](/beginners-guide.md).

## How does the scoring system work in Beat Saber? How does global ranking work?
We have sections on the [grips and tricks](/grips-and-tricks.md) page dedicated to the scoring and ranking systems,
check them out!

## My menus are blank and I have nothing to click on
If the main window in your game is blank, your save file likely got corrupted.

To fix it, navigate to:
`%AppData%\..\LocalLow\Hyperbolic Magnetism`

Delete or rename the Beat Saber folder to something else. When you re-enter the game,
it'll recreate the save file and should load the main menu properly.
