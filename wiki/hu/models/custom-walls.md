# Custom Walls

## Installation
:::tip NOTE Walls need to be made specifically for Quest or PC and are not interchangeable between the two. You can tell which platform a wall is for by the file extension. `.pixie` files are for PC while Quest uses `.zip` files. :::

### PC Walls
The latest Custom Walls plugin can be found in the [#pc-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord or in [Mod Assistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant).

Once installed, you should see a `CustomWalls` folder in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md). This folder is where you will place `*.pixie` files.

You can download more walls from the [#pc-walls channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord.

### Quest Walls
Custom Walls for Quest are provided by the Qosmetics mod. The latest version can be found in the [#quest-mods channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG Discord. Walls are called `qwalls` and are currently hosted in the [Qosmetics Community Discord](https://discord.gg/qosmetics).

## Usage

### PC Users
Inside the game in the main menu you will see on the left a `CUSTOM WALLS` button under the `Mods` section. Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which walls you want to use. There's also additional settings you can change, such as disabling the wall frames.

### Quest Users
Upload the wall zip file to your Quest using the [BMBF Web Interface](/quest-modding.md#installing-mods). You can then select which wall is active under the mods tab in BMBF.

## Creating Custom Walls
Although there's not currently a guide on how to create custom walls, one is in the works.
