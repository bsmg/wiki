## Ranking Up Mega-Tutorial
An incredible writeup by TeknozFR to help you get that PP. [Ranking & Scoring Guide](./ranking-guide)

## Scoring
See this video by the [Cube Community YT](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdG9zS8jVcQIKl7plwWXUkg) about how the scoring system works.

Additionally, here's an image from the game developers about how the [hitboxes](https://twitter.com/Split82/status/979365834324889600) work

## Ranking
*How does global ranking work? What are performance points? What are the numbers in my brackets? Why is my PP so small?*

You can find your global ranking and PP on [ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com/global) - here you can search for your name. Your ScoreSaber account is tied to your Steam / Oculus username.

1. Ranked songs are assigned PP (PP = performance points). The exact amount of PP gained is determined by the accuracy you finish a ranked song with. How much PP a ranked song is worth is determined by a secret algorithm developed by Umbranox, our Panda God.
2. To avoid having skilled players grinding lots of easier songs that are worth less PP, a curve is applied to your plays. This curve is `0.965^(x-1)` where `x` is the position of that score on your song list. e.g. If your top play is a 260 PP play, you will be rewarded 260 weighted PP which is a 100% of the raw PP of that play. If your second top play is 247 raw PP, you will be rewarded 238 weighted PP which is the actual amount of PP you get after the curve applies. Here is a table to illustrate this system:

| Raw PP | Weighted PP                  |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| 260pp  | **260pp** (100% of raw PP)   |
| 247pp  | **238pp** (96.5% of raw PP)  |
| 246pp  | **229pp** (93.1% of raw PP)  |
| 244pp  | **219pp**  (89.9% of raw PP) |

3. To get a better rank, there are quite a few tools you can use to find ranked songs that fit your skill level. First, it’s always good to go see your own [ScoreSaber](https://scoresaber.com/global) profile to see songs that you haven’t played in a while or that you could improve on and to know what your top scores look like. The [ScoreSaberEnhanced](https://github.com/Splamy/ScoreSaberEnhanced#readme) or [ScoreSaber Country Leaderboard](https://github.com/motzel/ScoreSaberCountryLeaderboard#readme) browser extension can extend the functionality of your profile. [BaliBilo's ScoreSaber site](https://scoresaber.balibalo.xyz/peepee) and [Beat Savior](https://www.beatsavior.io/) are external sites that can help you find maps to improve on and keep track of your performance.

You can find more information in the [Ranking & Scoring Guide](./ranking-guide.md).

## Grips
Cube Community made some videos showing off some of the more popular grips for Oculus Touch controllers (CV1) and Vive Wands.

### Valve Index Controllers
A video has not yet been made for Index controllers, but you can find some examples in their `#tips-and-grips` channel! [CC Discord](https://discord.gg/dwe8mbC)

### Oculus Quest 2
A video has not yet been made for the Quest 2's controllers, but you can find some examples below! ![Oculus Quest 2](~@images/grips-and-tricks/touch3-grips.jpg)

Check out Cube Community's `#tips-and-grips` channel for more suggestions and examples in their [Discord](https://discord.gg/dwe8mbC). Please remember that everyone's playstyle and body is different; someone else's grip might not work exactly like you need it to. Don't be afraid to experiment and find what's right for you!

## Improve Vive controller tracking
Your body may be blocking one lighthouse from seeing one of your controllers. Here are some steps that may help improve tracking.

1. Move into the corner of your playspace.
2. Rotate your body 45 degrees so that your lighthouses can see both controllers.
3. Rotate the room within Beat Saber's settings to compensate, so that you appear facing forward within the game.

![Vive Tracking Help](~@images/grips-and-tricks/vive-tracking-help.gif)

This can apply to Oculus sensors too.

## Touch Controller Battery Disconnect
The force of your swings in Beat Saber can cause the spring in the touch controllers to compress and disconnect the battery for a brief moment. This is what happens when you see your saber lose positional tracking but still rotate in place. To alleviate this, ragesaq recommends adding extra springs inside the battery compartment to decrease the likelihood of battery disconnects happening, explained in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/a2h7o4/psa_adding_an_additional_spring_to_the_battery/?st=JR9Q7OEZ&sh=a7a3d091)
