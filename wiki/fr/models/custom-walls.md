# Custom Walls
## Installation

translation-done: false

Once installed, you should see a `CustomWalls` folder in [your install folder](/faq/install-folder.md). This folder is where you will place `*.pixie` files.

You can download more walls from the [#pc-walls channel](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) in the BSMG discord.

## Usage
Inside the game in the main menu you will see a `CUSTOM WALLS` button at the top left of the Mods menu over by the release notes. Pressing it will open up the menu you can use to select which walls you want to use. There's also additional settings you can change, such as disabling the wall frames.

## Creating Custom Walls

Although there's not currently a guide on how to create custom walls, one is in the works.
