# Mapping Supports

The Mapping Support role is a symbol of thanks. Thanks for the thousands of messages sent in the mapping discussion
channel and time spent building and maintaining the mapping resources to help people learn how to make maps.
We don't typically give this role out, but when we do it's because someone has gone above and beyond for the server.

## Alzaraf

For some reason, spends way more time talking about mapping then actually mapping.
