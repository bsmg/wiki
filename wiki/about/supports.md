# Supports
The Support role is a symbol of thanks. Thanks for the thousands of messages and hundreds of hours spent helping people sort out their mods, and for for building a knowledge of troubleshooting base through macros and the wiki. We don't typically give this role out, but when we do it's because someone has gone above and beyond for the server.
