## 2021 Bloodcloak's Birthday Bash

In celebration of Bloodcloak's Birthday, this was a stage vc triva game show hosted by them based on a small impromptu
quiz they held in `#general` chat a few months before. The prize pool consisted of random Steam Game Keys, Steam Wallet
Codes, and Full and Classic Discord Nitro. Funding and prizes were generously donated by Pink, Bobbie, and Stemisty with
the rest covered by the events tier of our Patreon!

included:

- Music
- Guess that Song from the audio clip
- BSMG
- Hololive
- Food
- Random Stuff Other Staff Came Up With

Since it was celebrating Bloodcloak's Birthday, each contestant who participated got at least something from the prize pool.
The value of what they got depended on their overall performance.

The top 5 were brought back on stage for a head to head showdown for the role and grand prize of a Steam Wallet Code
worth $50 USD!
